<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dextranase, a hydrolase that specifically hydrolyzes α-1,6-glucosidic bonds, has been used in the pharmaceutical, food, and biotechnology industries. In this study, the strain of Catenovulum agarivorans MNH15 was screened from marine samples. When the temperature, initial pH, NaCl concentration, and inducer concentration were 30 • C, 8.0, 5 g/L, and 8 g/L, respectively, it yielded more dextranase. The molecular weight of the dextranase was approximately 110 kDa. The maximum enzyme activity was achieved at 40 • C and a pH of 8.0. The enzyme was stable at 30 • C and a pH of 5-9. The metal ion Sr 2+ enhanced its activity, whereas NH 4+ , Co 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Li + had the opposite effect. The dextranase effectively inhibited the formation of biofilm by Streptococcus mutans. Moreover, sodium fluoride, xylitol, and sodium benzoate, all used in dental care products, had no significant effect on dextranase activity. In addition, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that dextran was mainly hydrolyzed to glucose, maltose, and maltoheptaose. The results indicated that dextranase has high application potential in dental products such as toothpaste and mouthwash.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Dextran is a water-soluble polysaccharide linked by α-1,6-glucosidic bonds, which can be synthesized by bacteria such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus, and Rhizopus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Water-soluble exopolysaccharides of dextran mainly play a role in plaque formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. In addition, microbes use sucrose to produce large amounts of dextran, which has led to a decrease in the yield and quality of sucrose in the sugar industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. So far, several methods have been used to control the formation of dextran, such as antibacterial agents, mechanical removal, and biological enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. It has been proven that dextranase can hydrolase dextran safety and effectively.</p><p>Dextranase (α-1,6-d-glucan-6-glucanohydrolase, E.C.3.2.1.11), an inducible enzyme, is a hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-1,6-glucosidic bonds in dextran <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Bio-enzymatic hydrolysis of dextran is not only used in the preparation of dextran and its derivatives, but also plays an important role in the production of beverages and syrups in the food industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In sugar industries, dextranase can hydrolyze dextran in sugar juice, which can reduce its viscosity and increase the yield of sucrose <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. In medicine, dextranase can degrade the high molecular weight of dextran into a low molecular weight. The specific molecular weight of dextran has an antithrombotic effect and can be used as a blood substitute in emergencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Currently, dextranase produced by fungi is mainly added to oral care products such as toothpaste and mouthwash to treat oral biofilm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Larsson et al. reported on the catalytic reaction of Penicillium dextranase, the crystal structure of the enzyme, and the product complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The optimum temperature of dextranase produced by fungi was higher than 50 • C and unstable under alkaline conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It has also been reported that dextranase is mainly produced by terrestrial bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Cold-adapted enzymes from the ocean can serve as a source of new marine medicines <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and have enormous biotechnology potential in dairy products, sugar, detergents, and bioremediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>Dextranase produced by marine bacteria has the characteristics of alkali resistance, salt tolerance, and high catalytic activity at moderate temperatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Majeed et al. reported that alkaline dextranase may play an important role in the treatment of oral plaque because alkaline mouthwash products are more protective than enamel against acidic products <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Therefore, it is desirable to explore more marine bacterial dextranases. Dextranase with better characteristics is more suitable for oral care products and is still widely in demand for preventing dental caries.</p><p>In this study, we isolated marine bacteria producing dextranase; identified their physiological and biochemical characteristics and molecular biology; and then studied bacterial growth characteristics, dextranase properties, and the effect of plaque removal. All the results indicated that the characteristics of dextranase are excellent and worth studying to identify its further application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Screened Marine Strains Producing Dextranase</head><p>Five strains of dextran-producing strains were selected from blue dextran plates containing different marine samples. After comparing their hydrolysis abilities, the strain with highest enzyme-producing ability, MNH15 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), was selected (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Identification of Strain MNH15</head><p>The morphological and biochemical characteristics of strain MNH15 are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. The strain was Gram-negative, aerobic, short rod-shaped (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), grown at 37 °C, and did not grow at 4 °C. Using genomic DNA from strain MNH15 as a template, a 16S universal primer was used for polymerase chain reaction, and the amplified fragment was about 1.5 kb (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). After the PCR product was recovered, it was ligated to the pMD19-T cloning vector and transferred to E.-coli-competent cells, after which the positive clones were selected and sequenced to obtain a 1595 bp sequence. The 16S rDNA gene sequence was retrieved by GenBank and compared with its 16S rDNA sequence, and the phylogenetic tree was calculated using MEGA software ver. 5.0 and Clustal ver. 1.83. The phylogenetic tree indicated that strain MNH15 belonged to the genus Catenovulum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). On the basis of the morphological and biochemical characteristics combined with gene sequence analysis, the selected strain was recorded as Catenovulum agarivorans MNH15.</p><p>The optimum growth temperature was 35 • C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). The strain MNH15 could grow at a wide pH range, but a pH of 8.0 was optimum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). The strain was grown in a medium containing 1%-7% NaCl at an optimum concentration of 2% and did not grow without NaCl (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). The logarithmic growth phase of the strain was 3-6 h, and the dextranase activity increased gradually between 24 h and 48 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Dextranase-Producing Conditions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Effects of Carbon and Nitrogen Source on Dextranase Production</head><p>The effects of different carbon sources and nitrogen sources on the dextranase-producing strain MNH15 are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Barley flour was the best carbon source for the production of dextranase. Soluble starch and maltose had a slight effect on the strain producing dextranase. However, potato starch, tapioca starch, lactose, corn starch, glucose, rice bran, bran, sucrose, and dextrin could promote the production of dextranase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). Casein was the best nitrogen source (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>), followed by soybean meal and peanut meal, whereas casein was costly and unsuitable for large-scale fermentation. Therefore, soybean meal was selected as the nitrogen source.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Effects of Temperature, pH, and NaCl Concentration on Dextranase Production</head><p>The optimal temperature for producing dextranase from strain MNH15 was 30 • C. When the temperature was higher or lower, the dextranase-producing capacity changed sharply (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>). The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to the range of 5.0-10.0, and the dextranase activity was measured after 48 h of fermentation. At a pH of 8.0, the strain was most beneficial to dextranase production (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>). When the NaCl concentration was 5 g/L, the dextranase-producing capacity reached its peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>). Moreover, the NaCl concentration had a significant effect on the growth and the enzyme-producing capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3.">Effects of Inoculum Size, Aeration, and Inducer Concentration on Dextranase Production</head><p>As Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref> shows, the inoculum size had an important effect on dextranase production. The optimal inoculum amount was 3%. When 60 mL of medium was added to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, the amount of aeration was most favorable for dextranase production (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref>). The results clearly showed that the dextranase production needed an inducer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5f</ref>). A dextran T20 concentration of 8 g/L was the most beneficial to dextranase production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Enzymatic Characterization</head><p>The dextranase was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The band in the Coomassie blue-stained gel was consistent with the position of the transparent band in the blue dextran gel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). This result showed that the molecular weight of the dextranase was between 100 kDa and 130 kDa (around 110 kDa). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Effects of Temperature and pH on Dextranase Activity and Stability</head><p>The effect of temperature on dextranase activity is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>. Dextranase activity was very sensitive to temperature change, with the optimum temperature being 40°C. Dextranase activity peaked at a pH of 8.0, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>. The dextranase maintained a high activity level in the pH range of 6.0-8.0. In addition, the dextranase was very stable in the pH range of 4.0-9.0 at 25°C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>). The thermal stability of dextranase showed that the residual activity level stayed at almost 100% following storage for 5 h at 30 °C (pH 8.0), and nearly 50% of the enzyme activity was lost following storage at 45°C for 5 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Effects of Metal Ions and Reagents on Dextranase Activity</head><p>The effect of metal ions on dextranase activity is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>. In the presence of metal ions Sr 2+ , the dextranase activity increased from 100% (without adding compounds) to 128.71%, and the metal ions NH 4+ , Ni 2+ , Cd 2+ , Fe 3+ , Li + , Cu 2+ , and Co 2+ had a strong inhibitory effect on dextranase activity. Metal ions such as Ca 2+ , K + , Zn 2+ , Mg 2+ , and Ba 2+ did not have a significant inhibitory effect. Moreover, the main compounds in dental care products, such as sodium fluoride, xylitol, sodium benzoate, lauric acid, and ethanol, had no significant effect on dextranase activity. However, we found that 1 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) had a certain inhibitory effect on dextranase activity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), which was similar to results reported by Ren Wei et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">Substrate Specificity and Final Hydrolysis Products</head><p>The substrate specificity of dextranase was evaluated using materials with different glucosidic linkages (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Dextranase had high specificity for dextran containing α-1,6-glucosidic linkages. When the substrate concentration was 3%, the optimal substrate was dextran T500. However, the dextranase had poor hydrolysis ability for soluble starch, even though the soluble starch was composed of α-1,4-glucosidic bonds. Pullulan, chitin, cyclodextrin, and mannan are mainly composed of α-1,4-glucosidic bonds, and the dextranase was unable to hydrolyze them, either. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that maltoheptaose, glucose, and maltose were the main hydrolysates of dextranase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Moreover, the peak area of the hydrolysate detected by HPLC was quantified using Empower GPC software (Gel Permeation Chromatography-GPC) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>). When the hydrolysis reaction time was extended from 0.5 h to 3 h, the amount of maltotriose and maltotetraose decreased slightly, which was similar to results reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. This indicated that dextranase is an endotype dextranase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Effect of Dextranase on Plaque</head><p>Streptococcus mutans is considered to be one of the important bacteria responsible for forming dental plaque and caries. To investigate the inhibition of dextranase on the biofilm formation of S. mutans, the minimally biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of this enzyme was determined (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref>). The results showed that the experimental groups were significantly different from the control group, indicating that dextranase has a remarkable inhibitory effect on the formation of plaque. As the concentration of dextranase increased, the amount of plaque formed gradually decreased. When the dextranase concentration was 3 U/mL and 7 U/mL, the plaque inhibition rate was 52.3% and 91.79%, respectively.  </p></div>

When the concentration of dextranase was continuously increased, the adhesion of bacteria decreased, the biofilm gradually became thinner, and the structure became looser. The micro-plate crystal violet staining combined with scanning electron microscopy showed that the dextranase significantly inhibited the plaque formed by S. mutans.</p><p>The biofilm inhibitory rate was calculated at an absorbance of 595 (A 595 ) of the crystal-violet-stained biofilm without dextranase subtracted from A 595 of the biofilm with dextranase, and divided by A 595 of the biofilm without dextranase multiplied by 100%.</p></div>

Moreover, plaque supports bacteria in etching the teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Dextranase can remove plaque, but it is still a challenge to find a dextranase that is suitable for use in oral products. Compared with terrestrial-derived biological enzymes, marine enzymes are more suitable for industrial applications because of their salt tolerance, low temperature resistance, and alkali resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p><p>Catenovulum sp. is a new type of marine bacteria found in the marine environment in recent years, so there is little information on its properties, and there are few strains that produce dextranase. Compared with fungi and actinomycetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, bacterial fermentation production of dextranase has the advantages of a short fermentation time and a low temperature, which can save energy, manpower, and time in industrial applications. C. agarivorans MNH15 did not grow in the broth absence of NaCl, indicating that the strain is a halophilic bacterium that grows better at a pH of 8-9, and like C. agarivorans <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Compared with terrestrial bacteria, most marine bacteria are oligotrophic, and the enzyme-producing medium components are relatively easy to get, so C. agarivorans MNH15 has strong potential for application in industry settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><p>The molecular weight of dextranase of bacteria was found to be between 60 and 114 KDa <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>, and Koenig and Day found that the molecular weight of fungi was at least 23 KDa <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. In contrast, we found that the molecular weight of dextranase produced by C. agarivorans MNH15 was about 110 KDa. The bacterium of the same genus, Catenovulum sp. DP03, was found to have a molecular weight of about 75 KDa <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Thus, further research on the structure of dextranase may contribute to a better understanding of biochemistry and biocatalysis. The optimal pH of dextranase was found to be 8.0. Moreover, the pH of the dextranase produced by most strains, such as Arthrobacter sp. Arth410 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and T. pinophilus H6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, was acidic.

The dextranase had good catalytic activity at a temperature range of 35 • C-45 • C, which is similar to human body temperature, indicating that it can be applied to the development of oral care products.</p><p>The activity of dextranase increased to 128.71% under the treatment of 5 mM SrCl 2 , which was consistent with the results reported by Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. The same concentration of SrCl 2 had little effect on the activity of dextranase produced by the same genus Catenovulum sp. DP03 bacteria, reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ren Wei et al. [35]</ref>. Moreover, MgCl 2 , NH 4 Cl, and NiCl 2 only had a slight effect on dextranase activity, whereas CaCl , BaCl 2 , KCl, and ZnSO 4 had no significant effect on the activity of dextranase. The characteristics will benefit the application of oral care products <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The products of MNH15-dextranase-catalyzed substrate hydrolysis were mainly glucose, maltose, maltotetraose, and maltoheptaose, which was slightly different compared with other sources of dextranases <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. The main hydrolysate of Catenovulum sp. DP03 dextranase was isomalto-oligosaccharide, which produces a small amount of glucose over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The hydrolysates of T. pinophilus dextranase reported by Yu-Qi Zhang et al. were isomaltose and a small amount of isomalto-oligosaccharide <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p><p>We found that several reagents commonly used in dental care products, such as ethanol, sodium fluoride, xylitol, lauric acid, and sodium benzoate, had no significant effect of the dextranase activity.

We diluted the sample suspension with an appropriate amount of sterile distilled water and spread it evenly on a blue dextran plate. After incubating it for 2 d at 25 • C, the strain producing dextranase was selected according to a transparent zone around the colony. The colony diameter and the diameter of the transparent zone of the target strain on the plate were measured, and the hydrolysis ability was determined by the square of their ratios. The selected strains were inoculated into the fermentation shake flask (excluding agar and blue dextran 2000), and after fermentation at 180 • C for 48 h at 25 • C, the dextranase activity was measured using a standard method, and the strain with the highest enzyme production rate was selected.</p></div>

We then identified various physiological and biochemical reactions according to the Berger Bacterial Identification Manual (9th Edition, Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins). The genome of strain MNH15 was extracted with the bacterial genome extraction kit, and the 16S-rDNA gene was amplified with primers 27F (5 -AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3') and 1492R (5 -GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3').

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In summary, the dextranase-producing MNH15 strain of C. agarivorans was screened from marine samples. A higher yield of dextranase was produced when the temperature, initial pH, NaCl concentration, and inducer concentration were 30 • C, 8.0, 5 g/L, and 8 g/L, respectively. The maximum enzyme activity was performed at 40 • C and a pH of 8.0. The dextranase exhibited excellent thermostability and stability at a wide range of pH values (4.0-9.0). The molecular weight of dextranase was around 110 kDa. Sodium fluoride, xylitol, and sodium benzoate, all used in dental care products, had no significant effect on the activity of the dextranase. The result of the HPLC showed that dextran was mainly hydrolyzed to glucose, maltose, and maltoheptaose. Moreover, the dextranase effectively inhibited the formation of biofilm by S. mutans. Therefore, dextranase has strong application potential in dental products formulated to remove dental plaque.</p></div>
