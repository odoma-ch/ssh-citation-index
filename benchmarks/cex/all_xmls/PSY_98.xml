<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This study examined affect as it relates to the identity management (IM) experiences of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) workers. We integrate IM theories and evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis, 2007)</ref> within the framework of affective events theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996)</ref> to predict relationships among mood, identity management, and emotion at work. LGB participants rated aspects of positive and negative affect each work morning and immediately following IM situations at work over 3 weeks, making it possible to examine within-person changes and next-day consequences of IM. Our results provided little support for the notion that LGB workers' IM behaviors are driven by affect. However, there do appear to be affective consequences of IM behaviors. After concealment, participants experienced diminished positive affect and increased negative affect; in contrast, revealing was associated with increased positive affect and diminished negative affect. Additionally, these immediate affective consequences of identity management continued into the following day for some facets of affect. We examine these findings as they relate to the identity management and affect literatures, thereby building new insights into their intersections.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Individuals with concealable stigmas . . . face considerable stressors. These include having to make decisions to disclose one’s hidden status, anxiously anticipating the possibility of being found out, being isolated from similarly stigmatized others, and being detached from one’s true self . . . The ambiguity of social situations combined with the threat of potential discovery makes possessing a concealable stigma a difficult predicament for many individuals. — <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis, 2007, p. 328</ref></p><p>This brief description highlights a set of challenges lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people face. Indeed, being LGB often involves ongoing disclosure decisions, fears of being “outed,” difficulty identifying and accessing support networks, and ambivalence in self-views <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ragins, 2008)</ref>. Evidence confirms that LGB people make everyday decisions about “to whom, how, when, and where” <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Goffman, 1963, p. 44)</ref> to reveal or conceal their identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King, Mohr, Peddie, Jones, &amp; Kendra, 2017)</ref>. These identity management decisions are driven by a range of contextual and individual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clair, Beatty, &amp; Maclean, 2005)</ref> and can have profound effects on relationships and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barreto, Ellemers, &amp; Banal, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Laurenceau, Barrett, &amp; Rovine, 2005)</ref>. Fear of discovery is emphasized often and for good reason in studies of LGB workers, given the real potential for anti-LGB prejudice and discrimination in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ragins, Singh, &amp; Cornwell, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Deciding to reveal or conceal a stigmatized identity is often an emotional experience, yet the affective dimensions of identity management have rarely been empirically examined. Affect could function as both an antecedent and a consequence of LGB identity management. For example, a gay man who is about to start his first day of work may feel heightened anxiety about the desire to create a good impression, which may drive his decision to reveal or conceal his identity. His attempt to hide his identity at work, conversely, may itself create anxiety by encouraging him to monitor his behavior and be vigilant for signs that his concealment attempts may be discovered. This reciprocal influence between affect and disclosure decisions is featured in models of identity management experiences proposed for people with concealable stigmata <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis, 2007)</ref>. There is little research, however, about how affect influences and is influenced by the process of identity management, despite the central role of positive and negative affect in individual well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Diener, Suh, Lucas, &amp; Smith, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, we examine the potential interplay between affect and identity management in the everyday workplace experiences of LGB newcomer workers (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Workplace studies of identity management have provided evidence of links between global identity management strategies and general wellbeing, work satisfaction, and work behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brenner, Lyons, &amp; Fassinger, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chrobot-Mason, Button, &amp; DiClementi, 2001)</ref>. Such research, though valuable, neglects the dynamic aspects of identity management, that is, the process that each worker actively navigates from day to day, across diverse relationships and work experiences. The current study addresses this gap by using experience sampling methods to examine LGB workers' use of identity management strategies in specific workplace interactions over a 3-week period. This approach allowed us to examine the affective antecedents and consequences of specific identity management events, and minimize the impact of retrospective memory bias on findings.</p><p>We make several meaningful contributions to understanding identity management in the workplace. First and foremost, we integrate affective events theory and identity management (IM) theories by examining IM episodes as affective workplace experiences. This approach brings needed attention to the role of affect in the IM process and clarifies the relevance of affective events theory to the topic of stigma management in organizations. Second, the experience sampling design allows exploration of the temporal interplay between affect and IM, including the possibility that the emotional impact of concealing and revealing continues into the next work day. This focus on specific episodes is consistent with the call to increase understanding of affect in organizations by studying the events that give rise to emotional reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barsade &amp; Gibson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996)</ref>. Finally, our unique data allowed us to test whether individual differences in the IM patterns of LGB workers (specifically, global reports of outness and concealment motivation) predict their affective experience in future IM events. In so doing, we build a bridge between previous research findings-which concern global patterns of IM-and our event-based perspective on the affective dynamics underlying IM processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dispositional Affect, Mood, and Emotion</head><p>Three different types of affect are relevant to the current study: dispositional affect, mood, and emotion. These three types vary along the dimensions of intensity, duration, and etiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barsade &amp; Gibson, 2007)</ref>. Dispositional or trait affect refers to a person's enduring tendency to experience positive and negative affect. For example, someone who typically experiences situations as unpleasant would embody negative trait affectivity. Thus, trait affect cannot be described as intense, as it is just a way of being. It is a stable characteristic of a person that is thought to result from both nature (e.g., genetics) and nurture (e.g., parental and peer influence). In contrast, moods and emotions are transient affective experiences. They are often differentiated from one another on the basis of etiology. People are typically unaware of the cause of their moods, whereas emotions are reactions to discrete events or stimuli in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barsade &amp; Gibson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beedie, Terry, &amp; Lane, 2005)</ref>. This distinction partially explains the higher intensity and shorter duration of emotions relative to moods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barsade &amp; Gibson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Frijda, 1986)</ref>. The distinction also explains why emotions often are experienced as more specific phenomena than moods, as evident in the contrast between anger (specific) and a bad mood (diffuse). Indeed, the specificity of emotional reactions to events is thought to reflect appraisals of events on a number of characteristics (e.g., pleasantness, responsibility, control, anticipated effort; <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Two points about these affect-related variables bear mention in relation to the present study. First, both mood (assessed before work) and emotion (assessed immediately after IM events) played leading roles in the study. Dispositional affect, in contrast, took a back seat because of its relative stability over time, which was not aligned with our focus on within-person fluctuations in use of concealing and revealing strategies. Second, we faced the decision of whether to investigate broad, higher order dimensions of affect (e.g., positive affect) or narrow facets of affect (e.g., vigor). We opted to examine narrow facets, in part, given theory suggesting that identity management may impact diverse facets of emotion through different mechanisms (discussed below in our review of the literature). The lack of research in this area makes it difficult to speculate about the mechanisms might be most salient to the IM workplace events of LGB workers. For this reason, we believed there would be value in studying specific emotions.</p><p>This raises the question of which emotions to study. In the present study, we considered a set of affective facets-selfassurance, vigor, anger, anxiety, fatigue-that we believed would be directly relevant to concealing and revealing processes in the workplace. We grounded our selection of affective facets in the IM and broader stigma literatures, as well as basic affect theory. We note that these are certainly not the only facets of affect worthy of study in relation to managing a stigmatized identity. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis (2007)</ref> reviewed research indicating that concealment can give rise to emotions beyond those examined in the present study, such as guilt and sadness. We limited our attention to a small set of affective variables for practical reasons (e.g., survey length) but believed these variables would offer a basis for a solid initial foray into the emotional landscape of identity management.</p><p>Our selection process was guided in part by our desire to represent a diversity of affective experiences. Emotions have been characterized by a number of dimensions, including valence (pleasant vs. unpleasant), arousal, responsibility for event (self vs. other), and relation to approach versus avoidance goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000)</ref>. The facets of emotion we studied included differences on each of these dimensions. This is perhaps clearest for valence, given our selection of forms of positive (self-assurance, vigor) and negative (fatigue, anxiety, anger) affect. However, the facets also represented a range on the arousal spectrum, from low (fatigue) to moderate (selfassurance, vigor) to high (anger, anxiety; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Remington, Fabrigar, &amp; Visser, 2000)</ref>. Similarly, facets included emotions in which the responsible party is the self (self-assurance) and someone else (fear, anger). Finally, we studied some facets believed to be associated with the approach motivational system (selfassurance, vigor, anger) and some linked to the avoidance motivational system (fear; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009)</ref>. In short, although we were unable to represent the full diversity of emotions, we selected five emotions that vary widely on dimensions used to characterize affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Perspectives on the Affect and Identity Management Relationship</head><p>The current study examines whether affect influences and is influenced by LGB workers' use of concealing and revealing strategies. The notion that such interplay between affect and workplace experiences might exist is hardly new and was, in fact, proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Weiss and Cropanzano (1996)</ref> in their exposition of affective events theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996)</ref>. However, relatively little work has applied this general perspective on affective events to dynamics specific to management of a concealable stigma. In developing our hypotheses, we drew heavily on the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir and Fisher (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis (2007)</ref>, which represented among the first comprehensive attempts to synthesize theory and empirical evidence into models of identity management. That is, affective events theory specifies that workplace events can follow or precede affect and thus can help to frame exploration of affect in the workplace identity management process. In the current study, we integrate these perspectives by examining identity management experiences as a particular kind of workplace event that may have affective antecedents and consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect as an Antecedent of Identity Management</head><p><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir and Fisher's (2010)</ref> disclosure process model (DPM) serves as a launching point for considering the potential interplay between affect and concealing and revealing behaviors. Indeed, the DPM was developed as a framework for generating hypotheses about (a) when people will disclose their concealable identity, (b) when disclosure will lead to beneficial outcomes, and (c) the mechanisms that explain the effects of disclosure on outcomes. The DPM posits that the decision to disclose one's identity depends on the extent to which an IM event activates approach versus avoidance goals. Approach goals for disclosure involve moving toward a rewarding disclosure outcome, such as greater authenticity and relational intimacy. Avoidance goals, in contrast, involve moving away from a negative potential outcome of disclosure, such as social rejection and harassment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir and Fisher (2010)</ref> review research suggesting that activation of the approach motivational system is linked with positive affect and its known correlates, such as attending to positive features of one's immediate context and interpreting ambiguous stimuli in positive ways. In contrast, activation of the avoidance system is linked with negative affect, attention to negative aspects of one's environment, and negative interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. Thus, in the DPM, positive and negative affect are viewed as markers of the accessibility of approach and avoidance goals, respectively. This perspective has clear implications for the present study, which examines morning mood as a predictor of subsequent IM behavior (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). High levels of positive affect at the start of a given day, even if incidental and unrelated to one's status as an LGB person, should raise the likelihood of disclosure in IM events by increasing both the accessibility of approach goals and the perception of disclosure-supporting features of one's environment. For example, an LGB worker who starts the day in a positive mood may enter an IM event with greater than usual appreciation of the potential for disclosure to increase authenticity, as well as greater attention to aspects of colleagues' behavior hinting at a positive response to disclosure. This positive bias is unlikely to eliminate the anxiety inherent in disclosure of sensitive information; however, it may attenuate the anxiety and lead an individual to emphasize some of the potential benefits of disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010)</ref>. In contrast, negative morning mood should decrease the likelihood of disclosure by increasing the accessibility of avoidance goals and the perception of environmental cues that discourage disclosure. Research has not yet examined such possibilities with respect to stigmatized identities, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Forgas (2011)</ref> provided experimental evidence that positive mood increases the amount and intimacy of self-disclosure, regardless of the confidante's behavior. In contrast, negative mood was shown to increase the reciprocity of self-disclosure behavior, wherein the amount of personal information disclosed was more carefully linked to the confidante's disclosure behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect Facets and Identity Management</head><p>Our first hypotheses concern affect-specifically, facets of morning mood-as a predictor of particular forms of identity management: concealing and revealing behavior. Concealing can take the form of counterfeiting and avoiding strategies among LGB people, including providing false information to mask an LGB identity; preventing others from learning about an LGB identity; and avoiding discussions relevant to sexual orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clair et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Woods, 1994)</ref>. Consistent with the DPM, affect associated with the avoidance motivational system can influence the likelihood of engaging in concealment behavior. Avoidance goals, such as evading discrimination and prejudice, are often fueled by fear and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010)</ref>. For example, an LGB worker may start the day with higher than usual anxiety levels, which may increase the likelihood of pursuing avoidance goals in IM events (e.g., minimizing the opportunities for anti-LGB rejection) and tending to elements of the environment that signal a lack of LGB support. In contrast, fatigue is thought to signal the benefits of turning away from activities that are experienced as effortful <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Inzlicht, Schmeichel, &amp; Macrae, 2014)</ref>-a category that seems likely to include active identity management. From this perspective, LGB workers who start the day tired may navigate the day with a preference for activities that are perceived as relaxing and not cognitively taxing, which may reduce engagement in activities where identity management is required.</p><p>The case of anger does not fit neatly into the DPM because it is considered part of the approach motivational system, even though it also is typically viewed as a facet of negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009)</ref>. However, findings from research on anger led us to hypothesize that elevated angry mood in the morning would be associated with concealment in IM situations. For example, even though incidental anger has been linked with greater optimism and both tolerance and preference for risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Litvak, Lerner, Tiedens, &amp; Shonk, 2010)</ref>, this effect may not appear in situations where a person clearly lacks control of the outcome. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lerner and Keltner (2000)</ref> found that anger functions similarly to fear in such no-control situations, wherein heightened anger and fear both decrease optimism in risk assessments. Thus, in situations involving disclosure decisions, where there is no control over an interaction partner's response, anger may increase the perceived riskiness of disclosure. Moreover, incidental anger has been shown to reduce trust and increase attributions of blame <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Litvak et al., 2010)</ref>, which should discourage disclosure in IM situations. Also, studies have shown that anger is associated with avoidance goals when the anger is paired with anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009)</ref>-a likely scenario when IM decisions are at the fore and the expression of anger could have serious negative consequences for the worker. Thus, we hypothesize: Hypothesis 1a: Morning negative mood (anger, anxiety, fatigue) will positively predict the use of concealing behaviors and negatively predict the use of revealing behaviors during IM events that occur at work later in the day.</p><p>Our literature review also suggested routes through which positive mood may increase the likelihood of disclosure in IM situations. Those who reveal their stigmatized identity typically do so by either normalizing or differentiating themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clair et al., 2005)</ref>. Normalizing entails the individual minimizing the differences between their stigmatized identity and others, whereas differentiation involves prioritizing their stigmatized identity and ensuring that they are not marginalized because of it. According to the DPM, a positive mood should increase the chances of using such revealing strategies by increasing the accessibility of approach goals (e.g., having trusting work relationships) and turning attention to supportive aspects of the environment. Facets of positive mood may promote disclosure through specific mechanisms. For example, a high level of self-assurance may increase use of revealing strategies by boosting interpersonal self-efficacy. In contrast, vigor may increase disclosure by encouraging a view of effortful activities as rewarding and personally meaningful <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Inzlicht et al., 2014)</ref>. In short, although positive mood is unlikely to eliminate the anxiety that typically accompanies disclosure, it may facilitate disclosure by decreasing focus on potential risks, increasing awareness of opportunities for pursuing personally meaningful goals, and boosting confidence in one's interpersonal skills. Therefore, we hypothesize: Hypothesis 1b: Morning positive mood (self-assurance, vigor) will positively predict the use of revealing behaviors and negatively predict the use of concealing behaviors during IM events that occur at work later in the day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect as an Outcome of Identity Management</head><p>The DPM also posits mechanisms through which identity management (namely, disclosure) can influence (benefit) individual well-being. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir and Fisher (2010)</ref> discuss research on links between stigma disclosure and a range of outcomes; however, of most relevance to the present study are the large number of studies that have examined disclosure in relation to affect-related outcomes such as distress, positive affect, negative affect, and PTSD symptoms. The DPM depicts disclosure outcomes as part of a mediated process, wherein the potential benefits of disclosure for well-being occur through the effects of disclosure on multiple health-relevant processes (e.g., social support, active inhibition of thoughts and behaviors). From this perspective, disclosure can improve the subjective well-being of LGB workers by increasing their sense of social support from colleagues and reducing their engagement in effortful suppression of identity-related behavior. For example, once a worker reveals her lesbian identity to a colleague, she no longer has to expend the cognitive resources it may take to hide information about a female partner. The opposite process should be expected when LGB workers conceal their sexual orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Smart &amp; Wegner, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The potential benefits of revealing strategies for subjective well-being, of course, depend on the reaction of the confidante. Indeed, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir and Fisher (2010)</ref>, when disclosure is met with a rejecting or ambivalent response, the consequences can be decidedly negative for well-being-likely reducing perceived support and increasing cognitive strain due to worry and coping efforts. However, research suggests that disclosure may not typically carry such risks for LGB people. Indeed, a variety of studies have provided evidence of a positive association between overall disclosure level and affective well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jackson &amp; Mohr, 2016)</ref>. Even more germane to the present study is research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beals, Peplau, and Gable (2009)</ref>, who provided one of the few tests of the link between daily disclosure and affect among LGB adults. Participants completed a daily diary for 2 weeks and indicated whether they concealed or revealed their identities on days in which IM events occurred. Identity disclosure was linked with higher levels of daily positive affect, and this association was explained by the higher levels of perceived social support and identity-related emotional processing on days when participants disclosed their identity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beals et al. (2009)</ref> suggested that the overall positive impact of daily disclosures on affective and interpersonal well-being might indicate that LGB people are "skilled at picking disclosure recipients" (p. 876), consistent with evidence that everyday decisions about revealing one's sexual orientation are informed by a variety of situational cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affect Facets and Identity Management</head><p>The identity management literature has highlighted ways concealing and revealing a stigmatized identity may influence specific facets of positive and negative affect. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis (2007)</ref> reviewed studies suggesting that concealing a stigmatized identity sets in motion a preoccupation with the possibility of discovery. This, in turn, makes the stigmatized identity both more difficult to conceal and increasingly salient, thus generating fatigue from the high cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Smart &amp; Wegner, 2000)</ref> and anxiety from the fear of revealing accidentally. For similar reasons, we would expect concealment to decrease vigor and self-assurance. In partial support of this perspective, an experience sampling workplace study found that concealment of pregnancy was linked with an immediate increase in anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jones, 2017)</ref>. In contrast, receiving a positive reaction to one's disclosure should lessen preoccupation and vigilance and, in turn, boost self-assurance and vigor.</p><p>Additionally, although anger is less often discussed as a potential outcome of identity management, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis (2007)</ref> reviewed a number of studies in which concealment was positively related to hostility. One possible explanation for this relation is rooted in motivational models of emotion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carver and Harmon-Jones (2009)</ref> characterize emotions along two dimensions: (a) association with the approach versus avoidance motivational systems, and (b) whether motivation-related goals are being achieved or thwarted. In this model, anger signals thwarted efforts to achieve goals associated with the approach motivational system. From this perspective, anger may be a natural consequence of hiding one's LGB identity if doing so is experienced as a barrier to achieving disclosure-related goals (e.g., authenticity). Other possible explanations are based on established links between perceived injustice and anger <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Miller, 2001)</ref>. For example, LGB workers are likely to experience anger when they attribute their own use of concealing strategies to organizational or societal oppression, as well as when they are exposed to anti-LGB slurs, stereotypes, or jokes around coworkers to whom they are not out.</p><p>Taken together, this rationale and evidence suggests that concealing and revealing one's LGB identity have distinct affective consequences. On the one hand, concealing one's identity in an IM situation is likely to engage effortful self-regulation and preoccupation processes, as well as inauthenticity and disappointment, that are likely to increase fatigue and anxiety and reduce vigor and self-assurance. Anger, perhaps reflecting the frustration of failing to meet one's approach goals for disclosure (e.g., authenticity) or social injustice, may also follow from concealing. On the other hand, revealing one's identity is thought to benefit subjective well-being through a number of mechanisms such as social support and increased trust which likely benefits self-assurance and reduces anxiety. Additionally, because disclosure strategies may require fewer cognitive and emotional resources compared with concealing strategies, people who reveal their LGB identity may benefit from more vitality and self-esteem and lower anxiety and fatigue. Revealing a stigmatized identity also provides opportunities for achieving approach goals, which may reduce the experience of anger and frustration. Thus, we anticipate that: Hypothesis 2: The extent to which individuals conceal more during an IM event will be related to (a) increased negative This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>emotions (anger, anxiety, fatigue); and (b) decreased positive emotions (vigor, self-assurance) reported immediately following an IM event.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: The extent to which individuals reveal more during an IM event will be related to (a) decreased negative emotion (anger, anxiety, fatigue); and (b) increased positive emotion (vigor, self-assurance) reported immediately following an IM event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Next-Day Affective Consequences of IM Behavior</head><p>A logical question that arises when exploring the consequences of any event is whether the consequences persist the further in time one gets from the event itself. In the current investigation, we sought to examine whether concealing and revealing had lasting impacts on affect into the following work day (e.g., whether disclosure indirectly impacts next-day vigor through its immediate impact on vigor). The literature largely leaves the question of distal affective consequences unaddressed, but investigating potential lasting effects of IM behavior can inform our understanding of the nature of LGB identity management proposed in current IM models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Such possibilities are suggested by different strands of research. First, studies have linked stressful events to same-day increases in negative affect and decreases in positive affect, and some have found these same-day changes persisting into the next day <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fuller et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Marco &amp; Suls, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">van Eck, Nicolson, &amp; Berkhof, 1998)</ref>. Second, stigma-related stressors appear to have an especially marked impact on negative affect relative to other stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wang, Leu, &amp; Shoda, 2011)</ref>, which may increase the length of the affective response. Moreover, research has indicated that stigmarelated daily stress among LGB people increases rumination (i.e., repetitive thoughts about one's distress and circumstances related to the distress), which, in turn, prolongs the negative impact of the stressor on distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hatzenbuehler, Nolen-Hoeksema, &amp; Dovidio, 2009)</ref>. These findings raise the possibility that the effect of stressful IM experiences on emotion may be similarly pronounced and long-lasting because of their salience to social identity and their impact on rumination. Less has been written on positive experiences and positive emotions. However, it seems possible that affirming IM experiences could be similarly impactful (albeit in the direction of affective well-being) and could involve similar mechanisms. Based on this, we predict:</p><p>Hypothesis 4a: Use of concealing strategies will indirectly impact next-day mood through their immediate impact on the corresponding emotion.</p><p>Hypothesis 4b:</p><p>Use of revealing strategies will indirectly impact next-day mood through their immediate impact on the corresponding emotion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Difference Predictors of Identity Management Affect</head><p>Finally, although the primary focus of the present study was on within-person relations between use of IM strategies and affect, we investigated whether the affect experienced in IM events-on average-was predicted by global IM variables assessed before the experience sampling phase of the study. Specifically, we considered individual differences in the extent to which individuals are generally (a) open about their sexual identity at work (i.e., their level of outness at work); and (b) motivated to conceal their sexual identity. Research has established that these variables are interrelated but distinct. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jackson and Mohr (2016)</ref> found that outness and concealment motivation were negatively correlated (r ϭ Ϫ.62) and each accounted for unique variance in collective self-esteem. LGB participants who were open about their sexual identity tended to value their LGB identity and view themselves as worthy members of LGB communities, whereas participants who had high levels of concealment motivation tended to devalue their LGB identity, devalue themselves for being LGB, worry about whether others might reject them for their identity, and view themselves as poor members of LGB communities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Jackson and Mohr (2016)</ref> concluded that this pattern of results was consistent with the conceptualization of outness as an indicator of social integration and concealment motivation as an indicator of difficulty coping with both internal and external challenges of stigma.</p><p>This characterization of outness and concealment motivation aligns with theoretical arguments associating concealment and disclosure with distinct mechanisms impacting psychological wellbeing. Specifically, disclosure has been associated with approachfocused goals such as garnering social support and building trust and intimacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bosson, Weaver, &amp; Prewitt-Freilino, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010)</ref>, whereas concealment motivations have been linked to avoidance-related goals such as circumventing embarrassment, shame, and possible discrimination. Thus, both empirical and theoretical evidence support the distinctness of the two constructs.</p><p>In the case of IM episodes, a general predisposition toward openness about being LGB may reduce ambiguity. Greater previous experience of disclosure, to the extent it has been positive, may reduce fears about new identity management episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chaudoir &amp; Quinn, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">King et al., 2017)</ref>. Outness has been linked to greater levels of self-assurance and reduced anxiety about revealing, implying that outness should be associated with more positive and less negative emotions on average experienced during the identity management process. In contrast, identity management events are likely to be experienced as aversive to those high in concealment motivation, as these events should bring to the fore concerns regarding self-acceptance and acceptance from both heterosexual and other LGB people. As a result, individuals high in concealment motivation likely experience less positive and more negative emotions during IM events on average as compared with people who are low in concealment motivation. In light of the above reasoning, we posit that:</p><p>Hypothesis 5: Individuals who are higher in outness at work will experience (a) more positive emotion (self-assurance, vigor) and (b) less negative emotion (anger, anxiety, fatigue) during IM events on average as compared with individuals who are lower in outness at work.</p><p>Hypothesis 6: Individuals who are higher in concealment motivation will experience (a) less positive emotion (selfassurance, vigor) and (b) more negative emotion (anger, anxiety, fatigue) during IM events on average as compared with individuals who are lower in concealment motivation.</p><p>We tested these hypotheses in a series of surveys of LGB employees (depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The five affective facets-vigor, self-assurance, anger, anxiety, and fatigue-were assessed in (a) a baseline survey (to measure trait affect); (b) a workday morning survey (to measure mood); and (c) a survey completed after each workplace IM event (to measure situation-specific emotions). IM events were defined as any situation in which the person considered whether to reveal or conceal their sexual orientation. We anticipated that LGB employees' use of IM strategies would result in an immediate emotional response, which then would continue into the next day. Our focus was on within person relations among variables in this model, as this enabled consideration of temporal sequence in the key affective and situational constructs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants were recruited through advertisements in both general and LGB-oriented local publications. The study was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (Title: Daily Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Individuals, Protocol #5221). To increase heterogeneity of the sample, individuals responding to ads also shared study information with LGB peers who were not "out" at work. We compensated participants $20 after the first week of participation and $30 after completing the study.</p><p>At an initial meeting, participants completed a survey assessing person-level variables (i.e., workplace outness, concealment motivation, trait affect) and learned to operate the personal data assistant (PDA) used to collect data for the remainder of the study. In the following 3 weeks, they completed mood items just prior to going to work. They also completed surveys immediately following any identity management events they incurred at work in which we measured emotions and identity management behaviors they used during the event. Participants received reminder e-mails each work day of participation and met with research assistants at the midpoint and end of data collection to download data, address concerns, and-at the end-collect equipment and conduct a debriefing. The procedures described in this study are the same as <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">King et al. (2017)</ref>. This is because the current study analyzes data (though different outcomes) previously used in a separate publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were 61 LGB full-time workers in the Washington, DC region who worked in their office/unit for no more than 12 months (M ϭ 6.05 months, SD ϭ 3.73). The sample included 23 women (six bisexual, 17 lesbian) and 38 men (all gay identified). Ages ranged from 20 to 56 (M ϭ 30.48, SD ϭ 8.00). Seven participants identified as African American, four as Asian, four as Hispanic, two as Other, and 44 as White.</p><p>We focused on new employees because we reasoned they would have more disclosure opportunities than their longer tenured colleagues, who, on average, would have had more time in the organization to come out to peers. The number of participants is relatively small but comparable, if not larger, to that of several recently published articles in JAP using a similar experience sampling approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Rosen, Koopman, Gabriel, &amp; Johnson, 2016:</ref> N = 70; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lanaj, Johnson, &amp; Lee, 2016</ref>: N = 50; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beal, Trougakos, Weiss, &amp; Dalal, 2013</ref>: N = 63; <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">To, Fisher, Ashkanasy, &amp; Rowe, 2012</ref>: N = 30; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bledow, Schmitt, Frese, &amp; Kühnel, 2011</ref>: N = 55; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lanaj, Johnson, &amp; Wang, 2016</ref>: N = 68). We also note that the theoretical and empirical focus of this study was on the within-person level of the day, for which the sample size was N = 219.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>In the current study, affect is conceptualized in three distinct ways (i.e., dispositional, mood, emotions) and is therefore measured at three corresponding points in time. First, dispositional affect was measured at baseline prior to the primary data collection period and served as a covariate in our analyses. Second, mood was measured every morning over the course of the 3-week data collection period. Third, emotion was measured immediately following an identity management event. Importantly, we used the same scales to measure affective facets at each of these three points in time, which is described in detail in the person-level measures subsection below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Person-Level Measures</head><p>Outness at work. Outness at work was assessed with a modified version of the out to world subscale of the Outness Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2000)</ref>. Participants indicate their level of disclosure to specific people (e.g., mother) or types of people (e.g., work peers) using a fully anchored 7-point scale ranging from 1 (person definitely does not know about your sexual orientation status) to 7 (person definitely knows about your sexual orientation status, and it is openly talked about). A "not applicable" rating option was included for each item. The out to world subscale includes four items: new straight friends, work supervisor(s), work peers, and strangers. Subscales are scored by averaging all available ratings on the subscale items. To reflect our focus on the workplace context, we used the following four items to create the outness composite: work supervisor(s), work peer you are closest to, other work peers, and people you supervise at work. McDonald's omega, which provides a reliability estimate,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> was .88 in the current sample. Support for the validity of Outness Inventory subscales has been provided through expected correlations with identification with the LGB community and time spent in the coming out process <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2000)</ref> as well as sexual orientation privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Balsam &amp; Mohr, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Concealment motivation. The three-item concealment motivation subscale of the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mohr &amp; Kendra, 2011)</ref> was used to assess concern with and drive to protect one's privacy as an LGB person. Participants responded to items (e.g., "I keep careful control over who knows about my same-sex romantic relationships") on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Coefficient alpha ranged from .74 to .82 across samples in the instrument development study. McDonald's omega was .77 for the present study. Validity of the subscale has been evidenced by a positive association with self-concealment and negative association with outness to individuals in one's social world (e.g., heterosexual friends, work peers, strangers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mohr &amp; Kendra, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Affective facets. Affect was assessed with the three-item anxiety, anger, fatigue, and vigor subscales from the Profile of Mood States-15 (POMS-15; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cranford et al., 2006)</ref>, as well as an abbreviated three-item version of the self-assurance subscale of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Watson &amp; Clark, 1994)</ref>. Participants were asked to rate their level of each affect over the past month (e.g., "Over the past month, how ANXIOUS have you felt?") on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). Coefficient alphas for the POMS-15 subscales ranged from .66 to .87 in the sample of law school students examined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cranford et al. (2006)</ref>. In the present sample, McDonald's omega estimates were .92 for anxiety (sample item: on edge), .81 for anger (sample item: resentful), .90 for fatigue (sample item: worn out), and .79 for vigor (sample item: lively). Three of the six items comprising the self-assurance subscale were selected for the present study to control the length of the daily surveys: proud, strong, and confident (w = .85).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Event-Level and Daily Measures</head><p>Identity management behaviors. Situation-level use of identity management behaviors was assessed with the Identity Management Strategy Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King et al., 2017)</ref>. We adapted 12 items from two established instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson, Croteau, Chung, &amp; Distefano, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Button, 2001)</ref> designed to assess global strategies and reworded them so each item referenced behavior in a specific situation rather than typical behavioral strategies. Participants indicated use of each strategy using a fully anchored 4-point rating scale (1 ϭ not at all, 4 ϭ a lot). A multilevel exploratory factor analysis of items led to creation of separate scales at the within-person level: a two-item revealing scale (sample item: "I explicitly referred to my orientation") and a four-item concealing scale (sample item: "I let somebody assume that I was heterosexual"). In a measure validation study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King et al., 2017)</ref>, correlations between situational cues of LGB-related acceptance and rejection and use, respectively, of revealing and concealing strategies provided evidence for the validity of these scales. Furthermore, predicted associations also emerged at the person level, such as correlations of mean levels on revealing and concealing with selfreported LGB-related workplace policies and climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King et al., 2017)</ref>. Reliability of scores was estimated with two-level omega coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Geldhof, Preacher, &amp; Zyphur, 2014)</ref>. For revealing, within-and between-person omegas were, respectively, .87 and .95. For concealing, within-and between-person omegas were, respectively, .82 and .95.</p><p>Affective facets. Affect each work morning and after each IM event was assessed with the same measures used to assess dispositional affect (described previously). However, items referred to the respondent's current levels of affect (e.g., "At this moment, how ANXIOUS do you feel?"). Within-person reliability coefficients for the POMS-15 subscales ranged from .75 to .88 in the law school student sample examined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cranford et al. (2006)</ref>. In the present sample, within-and between-person omega estimates were, respectively, .89 and .94 for anxiety, .88 and .97 for anger, .94 and .98 for fatigue, .89 and .97 for vigor, and .86 and .98 for the self-assurance subscale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Links between IM behaviors and affect could potentially exist at both the within-person and between-person levels. To estimate the within-person relations that were the focus of our analysis, we used the multilevel structural equation model described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Preacher, Zyphur, and Zhang (2010)</ref>. In this model, regression coefficients for predictors assessed at the lowest level are interpreted as though they have been group-mean centered. One implication of group-mean centering for such predictors is that the Level 2 regression coefficients reflect the combined association between predictor and outcome at both levels of analysis. A proper test of the pure Level 2 association involves demonstrating that the Level 2 regression coefficient is significantly greater than the corresponding Level 1 regression coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Enders &amp; Tofighi, 2007)</ref>. Thus, for the present study, person-level effects of IM strategy on affect were examined by testing the difference between corresponding Level 2 and Level 1 path coefficients. Nonnormality and the small amount of missing data were handled using robust full information maximum likelihood estimation as implemented in Mplus software Version 8.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998-2012)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, to test the within-person indirect effects of IM strategy use on next-day affect (through immediate affective response), we used the parametric bootstrap approach described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Preacher et al. (2010)</ref> and implemented using the online utility provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Selig and Preacher (2008)</ref>. This method makes no assumptions about the distribution of the indirect effect and is easily implemented using standard multilevel software. The needed variance and covariance estimates for the path coefficients were obtained from the asymptotic covariance matrix, and the bootstrap procedure was repeated 20,000 times. As recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Preacher et al. (2010)</ref>, we used the parametric bootstrap to generate 90% confidence intervals of the indirect effect (corresponding to one-tailed hypothesis tests at the .05 level), given the lower power associated with tests of indirect effects relative to direct effects. Statistical significance is inferred when a confidence interval does not contain 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Univariate descriptive statistics for the main study variables are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; bivariate correlations among variables are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> We first present findings regarding the links between morning mood and same day IM behavior (Hypothesis 1, Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Next, we present results regarding IM behavior as a predictor of immediate affect (Hypotheses 2 and 3, Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and next-day affect (Hypothesis 4, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). Finally, we describe findings regarding the extent to which outness at work and concealment motivation shape average IM affect (Hypotheses 5 and 6, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>Hypotheses 1-4 were all tested with results from the same multilevel path model. For each analysis, morning mood was included as a predictor of both IM strategy and IM emotions (i.e., affect ratings provided immediately after an IM experience). In addition, IM strategy was included as a predictor of IM emotions. These paths were included in the model for both Level 1 and Level 2. At Level 1, we included next-day morning mood as an outcome of all current variables (morning mood, IM strategy, and IM emotions). At Level 2, we controlled for the effect of dispositional affect (collecting prior to primary data collection period) on morning mood, IM strategy, and IM emotions. Separate models were run for each combination of IM subscale (conceal or reveal), and each affective facet (anxiety, anger, fatigue, vigor, or self-assurance). Model fit was trivially perfect because all pairs of variables were connected through paths or covariances (all CFIs &gt; .99); thus, goodnessof-fit statistics are not reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does Morning Mood Predict Same-Day Concealing and Revealing?</head><p>In no case did morning mood predict use of concealing strategies (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) or revealing strategies (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) later in the work day at the p &lt; .05 level, failing to support Hypothesis 1a and Hypothesis 1b Specifically, in the within-person model, concealing strategies were not predicted by morning anxiety (b = -0.053, SE = 0.075, p = .476), anger (b = 0.005, SE = 0.117, p = .965), fatigue (b = -0.137, SE = 0.071, p = .055), vigor (b = 0.004, SE = 0.106, p = .973), or self-assurance (b = -0.047, SE = 0.111, p = .675). Similarly, revealing strategies were not predicted by morning anxiety (b = 0.097, SE = 0.078, p = .215), anger (b = 0.115, SE = 0.075, p = .122), fatigue (b = 0.022, SE = 0.092, p = .809), vigor (b = 0.024, SE = 0.076, p = .751), or self-assurance (b = 0.054, SE = 0.087, p = .533).</p><p>Although our focus was on within-person relations, we examined the between-person tests of contextual effects of morning mood on later-day use of concealing and revealing strategies. Only one test was statistically significant: Anger was positively associated with use of concealing strategies (b ϭ 1.357, SE ϭ 0.675, p ϭ .044). In other words, the participants who generally reported high levels of anger and frustration in the morning were more likely than others to use concealing strategies over the course of the study.</p><p>Finally, we considered the possibility that morning mood might predict whether an IM experience occurs at all. To investigate this possibility, we created a binary variable reflecting whether an IM experience had occurred on each day of participation for each participant. We then regressed this variable on each of the morning mood variables in a series of simple multilevel logistic regressions. None of the relations between morning mood and occurrence of an IM experience was statistically significant at either level of analysis (all p values Ͼ .10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Are Concealing and Revealing Associated With Immediate Change in Emotions?</head><p>Analyses indicated that IM strategies were associated with most of the IM emotion variables, controlling for morning mood. As indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, event-level concealing was associated with an immediate increase in negative emotions (anxiety, anger, fatigue) and an immediate decrease in positive emotions (vigor, self-assurance) relative to same-day morning mood, providing support for Hypothesis 2a and Hypothesis 2b. Specifically, in the within-person model, concealing strategies were linked with concurrent levels of anxiety (b = 0.300, SE = 0.071, p &lt; .001), anger (b = 0.215, SE = 0.084, p = .011), fatigue (b = 0.155, SE = 0.072, p = .032), vigor (b = -0.329, SE = 0.095, p = .001), and self-assurance (b = -0.333, SE = 0.082, p &lt; .001).</p><p>Conversely, event-level revealing was associated with a decrease in negative emotions (with the exception of fatigue) and an increase in positive emotions (vigor, self-assurance), supporting Hypothesis 3b and providing partial support for Hypothesis 3a (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Specifically, revealing strategies were linked with concurrent levels of anxiety (b = -0.182, SE = 0.058, p = .002), anger (b = -0.211, SE = 0.068, p = .002), vigor (b = 0.228, SE = 0.071, p = .001), and self-assurance (b = 0.344, SE = 0.081, p &lt; .001); but not fatigue (b = -0.030, SE = 0.072, p = .680).</p><p>Our focus was on the within-person analyses. However, it is worth noting that none of the contextual effects of concealing and revealing on affect was statistically significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does IM-Related Change in Emotions Persist Into Next Day Mood?</head><p>We next tested Hypothesis 4, which concerned the notion that changes in emotions resulting from IM behaviors persist into the next day. To examine possible distal affective consequences, we tested the within-person indirect effects of IM strategy on next-morning mood through IM emotions. Point estimates for these indirect effects at Level 1 were calculated by forming the product of coefficients for the path from predictor (IM strategy) to mediator (IM emotions) and the path from mediator (IM emotions) to outcome (next workday morning mood). Indirect effects were tested with 90% confidence interval estimates generated using the parametric bootstrap approach described above.</p><p>As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, next-day affective consequences were found in the expected directions for vigor and self-assurance with respect to both concealing strategies (vigor CI [-0.094, -0.019]; self-assurance CI [-0.060, -0.005]) and revealing strategies (vigor CI [0.009, 0.068]; self-assurance CI [0.002, 0.080]). Also, a next-day affective consequence was found for fatigue with respect to concealing strategies, CI [0.001, 0.050]. Thus, at the withinperson level, concealing was linked with decreased levels of vigor and self-assurance and increased levels of fatigue (relative to the person's morning mood) that persisted into the morning of the next work day. Conversely, revealing was linked with increased levels of vigor and self-assurance that persisted into the next work day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do Outness at Work and Concealment Motivation Predict Average IM Emotions?</head><p>The main purpose of this article was to investigate the withinperson affective consequences of concealing and revealing. However, we believed it also would be valuable to study person-level antecedents of IM emotions. Individual differences in behavioral and motivational aspects of identity management might influence IM emotions through their impact on IM behavior and perhaps even through other pathways. The former possibility was supported by the substantial person-level correlations observed between outness at work and aggregated ratings of both concealing behavior, r = -.78, p &lt; .001 and revealing behavior, r = .54, p &lt; .001. Similarly, concealment motivation was correlated with both concealing, r = .50, p &lt; .001, and revealing, r = -.32, p = .022. These findings also provide evidence of convergent validity for these the new measures of concealing and revealing behavior.</p><p>The final set of analyses focused on the extent to which average IM emotions-aggregated to the level of the person-were predicted by outness at work and concealment motivation. Each analysis consisted of an ordinary least squares regression, wherein average IM emotion was regressed on one of the two person-level predictors (outness or concealment motivation). Each analysis also controlled for trait affect (provided at baseline) and aggregated morning mood ratings (provided during the main part of the study). Controlling for dispositional affect and aggregated morning mood ratings increased confidence that any associations found of both outness and concealment motivation with subsequent IM emotion would be free of the influence of general emotional tendencies.</p><p>As indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, ratings of outness at work at baseline predicted subsequent IM emotions for all affective facets except fatigue and vigor, providing partial support for Hypothesis 5. Specifically, outness at work was negatively associated with IMrelated levels of anxiety (b = -0.18, sr 2 = .26, p &lt; .001) and anger (b = -0.11, sr 2 = .08, p = .018), and positively associated with IM-related levels of self-assurance (b = 0.12, sr 2 = .04, p = .041). In contrast, outness at work was not found to be related to IM-related levels of fatigue (b = -0.08, sr 2 = .04, p = .076) or vigor (b = 0.08, sr 2 = .02, p = .128). We next examined whether this pattern of results changed after controlling for use of concealing and revealing strategies over the course of the study (aggregated to the person level). After controlling for IM strategy use, outness at work was no longer a statistically significant predictor of anxiety (b = -0.08, sr 2 = .03, p = .269), anger (b = -0.10, sr 2 = .04, p = .186), or self-assurance (b = 0.01, sr 2 = .00, p = .903); and continued to be unrelated to vigor (b = 0.07, sr 2 = .01, p = .436), However, the negative relation between outness at work and fatigue strengthened after controlling for concealing and revealing and became statistically significant (b = -0.18, sr 2 = .12, p = .015).</p><p>In support of Hypothesis 6b, concealment motivation at baseline predicted subsequent IM emotions for the negative affective facets, and specifically was positively associated with IM-related levels of anxiety (b = .19, sr 2 = .19, p = .001), anger (b = .15, sr 2 = .11, p = .005), and fatigue (b = .17, sr 2 = .11, p = .001). Failing to support Hypothesis 6a, concealment motivation was not related to positive emotions experienced during IM situations: vigor (b = -0.12, sr 2 = .03, p = .078) or self-assurance (b = -0.09, sr 2 = .02, p = .209). This pattern of statistical significance changed only for anxiety after controlling for use of concealing and revealing strategies. Concealment motivation was no longer a statistically significant predictor of anxiety (b = 0.10, sr 2 = .04, p = .104). In contrast, concealment motivation continued to lack a relation to both vigor (b = -0.09, sr 2 = .01, p = .225) and self-assurance (b = 0.00, sr 2 = .00, p = .998), and continued to have a statistically significant association with both anger (b = 0.13, sr 2 = .05, p = .042) and fatigue (b = 0.23, sr 2 = .05, p &lt; .001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Despite growth in scholarship on identity management processes in and out of the workplace, surprisingly little research has examined specific experiences of disclosure and concealment. This study offers initial insights regarding the affective landscape of identity management for LGB workers, and raises questions that point to areas for future research. Regarding the affective antecedents of IM behaviors, our hypotheses received little support: Morning mood generally did not predict the extent to which people revealed or concealed their LGB identities later in the day (i.e., the extent to which they concealed or revealed). With respect to the affective consequences of IM, our hypotheses received much stronger support. Our findings indicated that IM behaviors resulted in immediate emotional consequences which, in some cases, shaped next day mood. Finally, we found that individual differences in outness and concealment motivation predicted emotions in future IM experiences at work. Many, but not all, of these effects were attributable to the IM strategies typically used in those IM experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>One of the most consistent results of this study was the lack of relation between incidental affect, in the form of morning mood, and subsequent IM behavior. These findings are discrepant with evidence that positive moods increase disclosure amount and intimacy and that negative moods lead to a more cautious disclosure style <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Forgas, 2011)</ref>. This discrepancy may be due to differences in research design and the disclosure context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Forgas (2011)</ref> had participants respond to imaginary scenarios (Studies 1 and 2) or participate in a structured computer-mediated exchange with a peer (who actually was a research assistant; Study 3). In all cases, participants were asked to make self-disclosures but no guidance was provided regarding content. In contrast, the LGB workers in our study reported on actual work experiences regarding opportunities to disclose information that is often considered highly sensitive.</p><p>If it is the case that affect (mood, as measured in the current study) does not shape IM decision-making, this would suggest that identity management is a judgment-driven behavior as opposed to affect-driven behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Weiss &amp; Cropanzano, 1996)</ref>. This does not necessarily mean that deliberate thought goes into making IM decisions, but rather that decisions are not driven by affect. Indeed, it is generally believed that people with concealable identities actively consider cues and clues regarding the extent to which disclosure in an IM situation would be met with support versus rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(King et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis, 2007)</ref>. This strategic use of environmental and interpersonal acceptance cues-rather than affective states-may be typical for decisions about something potentially consequential, such as disclosing one's sexual orientation at work.</p><p>Despite the overall lack of association between morning mood and same-day IM behavior at the within-person level, one relation emerged at the person level: Morning anger was positively associated with concealing behavior, suggesting that the LGB workers who are generally higher in anger are also generally more likely to conceal their identities. This relation may reflect the impact of anger on person perception, for example, increasing attributions of blame and responsibility toward others and decreasing trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009)</ref>. Alternatively, a third variable could be responsible for this association. For example, a negative organizational climate for sexual diversity could simultaneously fuel anger and encourage concealment among LGB employees.</p><p>The other highly consistent finding in the study was support for the notion that IM strategies can influence emotions. Use of concealing strategies was associated with an immediate increase in the negative emotion variables and a decrease in positive emotions. The opposite pattern was found for use of revealing strategies. These findings, similar to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beals et al. (2009)</ref>, raise important questions about the role of the confidante's response in shaping the outcome of disclosure. Robust evidence of anti-LGB discrimination and prejudice in the workplace is clear indication that not every workplace disclosure is met with acceptance and support <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mohr &amp; Fassinger, 2012)</ref>. Given the reality of unsupportive responses to disclosure, why would disclosure, on average, be expected to enhance affective well-being for LGB workers? Though this question has not yet been carefully investigated in research, one answer may be-as suggested previously-that LGB people make careful use of environmental cues to determine when a positive response to disclosure is likely. From this perspective, we may have found a positive relation between daily disclosure and positive affect because the LGB participants were most likely to disclose when they had reason to believe there would be a rewarding outcome. This possibility points to a potentially fruitful area for research.</p><p>Another informative aspect of these results is the fact that findings were nearly identical for the three facets of negative emotion and the two facets of positive emotion, particularly with respect to immediate consequences of identity management. These results may indicate that the affective impact of concealing and revealing is nonspecific and concerns the overarching distinction between pleasant and unpleasant affect only. Another explanation is based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Carver and Harmon-Jones's (2009)</ref> discussion of why anger and fear so often co-occur empirically when they are believed to be associated with different motivational systems (approach and avoidance, respectively). They note that their co-occurrence may be a function of the contexts in which they typically are experienced. Circumstances that involve threats to be avoided (which would elicit fear) also often involve barriers to rewarding goals (which would elicit anger).</p><p>In contrast to results for immediate outcomes of IM events, results were not identical for all affective facets when considering our prediction that next day mood would be impacted by IM behaviors. We observed continuing effects of both positive IM emotions into the following day for both concealing and revealing behavior. A similar effect was found for fatigue with respect to concealing behavior. Why next-day effects were found for these three facets of affect but not anger and anxiety is unclear. It is noteworthy that vigor and self-assurance have been found to be strongly associated with the experience of authenticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Lenton, Slabu, &amp; Sedikides, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">van den Bosch &amp; Taris, 2014)</ref>, which is believed to reinforce indicators of well-being such as work engagement, life satisfaction, decreased strain and distress and healthy psychological functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Emmerich &amp; Rigotti, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lenton et al., 2016)</ref>. Achievement of disclosure-related authenticity goals is often discussed as a central concern for people with concealable stigmata <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clair et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jones &amp; King, 2014)</ref>; thus achieving a greater sense of authenticity through disclosure may be sufficiently great to continue into the next day. In short, the continuation of vigor and self-assurance into the next work day may represent the lasting impact of achieving a personally significant goal through disclosure.</p><p>Finally, this work also contributes to the theoretical understanding of how individual differences play a role in predicting affective experiences during IM events. Findings suggest that LGB workers who are more out at work generally experience more self-assurance and less anger and anxiety during IM events, and that this effect appears to result from the IM strategies that the workers typically use. Further, individuals who are high in concealment motivation experience relatively more negative emotions when managing their identities at work relative to others. Notably, the links between concealment motivation and both anger and fatigue continued to be statistically significant even after controlling for use of IM strategies. Thus, something other than IM behavior explains the increased IM-related anger and fatigue experienced by those high in concealment motivation. This makes sense when considering that concealment motivation, unlike outness, is an internal phenomenon-one that is linked with self-rejection and acceptance concerns. Thus, a person with high levels of concealment motivation may find IM events particularly uncomfortable because they raise painful unresolved issues for the personissues that go beyond the person's use of concealing or revealing strategies in an IM event.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Our results suggest that the affective well-being of LGB workers is enhanced by opportunities to reveal their identity and avoid concealing. Notably, the facets of affect most impacted by identity management (in terms of continuing into the next day) are strongly associated with authenticity. This underscores the value of encouraging authenticity in the workplace for both the organization and worker, given evidence benefits of authenticity to productivity, job satisfaction, and work engagement to reduced turnover intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Emmerich &amp; Rigotti, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Martinez, Sawyer, Thoroughgood, Ruggs, &amp; Smith, 2017)</ref>. Similarly, a wealth of research suggests that positive affect provides advantages in a wide variety of organizational tasks, roles, and behaviors, such as pro-social behavior, group dynamics, decision making, leadership, and turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barsade &amp; Gibson, 2007)</ref>. An LGB-friendly, open workplace will minimize the press to conceal sexual orientation and facilitate disclosure, thereby enhancing their positive affective experiences. Thus, employers would help both their employees and their bottom line by focusing on creating an accepting and inclusive organizational climate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Our findings must be understood in light of the limitations of our methodology. One important boundary condition is that our findings are based on self-report, which is problematic in that individuals do not always accurately report events, behaviors, or even emotions. Additionally, we only have data on the disclosure experiences of people who were sufficiently comfortable with their LGB identity to participate. Despite this limitation, it is worth noting that nearly the full range of scores was represented in our measure of outness at work. A second limitation of our sample is that we did not assess the perceptions of participants' interaction partners. Consequently, we cannot ascertain whether the IM experiences were positively or negatively received by confidantes. This is potentially important because participants may not be accurate judges of others' reactions to their disclosure or concealment. However, this may be irrelevant because IM is a process that is based on an individual's self-construal. Therefore, participants' perceptions of their social environment in effect constitute reality. Nevertheless, there may be negative interpersonal dimensions that we could not capture without the recipient's perspective. Finally, it is important to highlight the fact that our data do not permit causal inferences. We attempted to strengthen the ability to reach conclusions about direction of influence by modeling temporal relations among variables, as well as by controlling for stable aspects of affect across different parts of the study. However, these measures do not erase the fact that ecologically valid experimental work on identity management is needed to reach conclusions about causal relations.</p><p>These limitations notwithstanding, findings provide one of the first quantitative investigations of LGB worker's IM experiences and also point to intriguing directions for research. For example, results raise questions about the mechanisms underlying the continuation of IM-related affect into the next day. IM events may lead LGB workers to engage in coping efforts (e.g., support seeking) and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination, savoring) that could keep the affective impact of the event alive into the next day and potentially beyond. Moreover, insights regarding the present findings would be deepened by incorporating features of IM models to a greater extent. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir and Fisher's (2010)</ref> DPM suggests that features of disclosure events, such as the disclosure characteristics (e.g., depth, length, emotional content) and the confidante's reaction, can influence the impact of the event on mediating processes and outcomes. Additionally, this model highlights the role of approach and avoidance goals in both the use and impact of specific IM strategies. This aspect of the model informed our hypotheses about the influence of incidental affect on subsequent IM behavior, given the association of approach and avoidance goals with positive and negative affect, respectively. Direct assessment of these goals would have clarified the nature of our current findings and offered a test of a core component of the DPM.</p><p>Finally, we believe longitudinal research over a longer span of time would illuminate important aspects of identity management in the workplace. The models proposed by both <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Chaudoir and Fisher (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pachankis (2007)</ref> both feature feedback loops, wherein the outcomes of IM events are thought to influence perceptions, attributions, motivations, and interpersonal behavior in future IM events. For example, the fulfillment of authenticity goals through disclosure may lead to a cascade of positive effects on individual, interpersonal, and organizational factors that, in turn, could increase the salience of approach goals in subsequent IM experiences. Research that can capture such processes from one IM event to the next will increase understanding of the broader IM process and test key components of IM models. Moreover, such research could be used to examine ways the affective reactions to IM events may transform in response to coping efforts and their outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The workplace, like other settings, is an arena for affective ups and downs. Possessing a concealable stigma, however, introduces additional tasks of emotional significance-tasks that may influence peer relationships, job satisfaction, and even job security <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clair et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jones &amp; King, 2014)</ref>. Though it is recognized that the tasks of identity management are part of a dynamic process that workers navigate across diverse situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010)</ref>, little research has examined this process at the event level. The present study provides among the first evidence that LGB workers' use of IM strategies in specific situations predicts changes in positive and negative affect that, in some cases, are sufficiently impactful to persist into the next day. We hope this study stimulates future research to answer some of the questions we were unable to address about mechanisms and moderators of the IM process.</p></div>
