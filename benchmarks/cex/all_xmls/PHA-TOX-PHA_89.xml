<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Developing a novel multifunctional theranostic agent for cancer combination therapy has attracted tremendous attention in recent years. In this report, we designed and developed a new multifunctional nanocarrier based on anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody-conjugated and paclitaxel loaded-thiol chitosan-layered gold nanoshells (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) as a theranostic agent for the first time used for fluorescence/photoacoustic dual-modal imaging-guided chemophotothermal synergistic therapy. The resulting anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs showed excellent biosafety, biocompatibility, broad near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, photostability, fast and laser irradiation-controllable drug release, and higher targeting efficiency for efficient chemophotothermal combination therapy of cancer under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI). The combination therapy was investigated in vitro and in vivo, displaying a powerful anticancer efficiency. More importantly, an in vivo experiment of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs with laser irradiation showed heavy damage to the tumor tissue, killing the tumor cells almost completely. Anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs also showed a powerful capacity to visualize tumors, and therefore it is considered a new PAI contrast agent for subsequent therapy. Histological analysis and TUNEL assay further showed much more apoptotic cells, confirming the value of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs. Our results provide a new concept and a promising strategy to develop a novel multifunctional nanotheranostic agent for future clinical applications in diagnosis and therapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Applications of biocompatible nanomaterials as multifunctional theranostic agents that combine diagnosis and therapy have recently been developed for use in disease treatment because of the various advantages of the reduced rate of recurrent tumors and minimized side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In particular, combination therapies such as photoacoustic imaging (PAI), chemotherapy, and photothermal therapy (PTT) have recently attracted a great deal of attention because of their good biosafety, deep penetration, highly targeted nature, and noninvasiveness, which can significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. PAI is considered to be an emerging method and has deeper tissue penetration and higher spatial resolution, which can be used for precise anatomical localization of a tumor <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Chemotherapy is still the best choice in cancer treatment because of its high efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. PTT has recently drawn considerable attention as a minimally invasive therapeutic technique to ablate cancer cells, which uses nanoparticles that absorb near-infrared (NIR) light to convert laser light energy into cytotoxic heat to ablate the cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This technique has several advantages such as high selectivity, harmlessness, and minimal damage to surrounding normal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, NIR-light-absorbing nanoparticles have been proposed for photothermal ablation cancer therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Gold-based nanomaterials have also attracted extensive attention as excellent candidates for PTT because of their good biocompatibility and low toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In particular, gold nanoshells (GNSs) commonly contain a silica core and a thin layer of gold. GNSs are considered a promising material for significantly enhancing the photothermal efficiency because of their high photothermal conductivity and strong absorption in the NIR region <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. For further enhancement of polymer coating and anticancer drug loading, higher targeting, and a better therapeutic efficiency, a variety of thiol chitosan (TCS), paclitaxel (PTX), and antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies have been conjugated to the GNS surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>Chitosan (CS) is a positively charged biopolymer that has attracted much attention in the biomedical field as a biomaterial because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and nontoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, the only drawback of CS is mainly its poor solubility at normal pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In order to solve this problem of CS, various derivatives of CS (e.g., TCS) have been recently used for biomedical applications. TCS is highly water-soluble, has a low molecular weight, and biocompatible <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Dithiol ligands, including lipoic acid (LA) has a disulfide-containing lipoic ring that is commonly used to bind to the surface of GNSs; this dithiol-gold linkage is very strong, offering long-term stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. PTX is an anticancer drug that is commonly used for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. However, the main drawback of PTX is its poor solubility in its natural form <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In order to overcome these limitations of PTX, various drug delivery vehicles (e.g., polymer) have been recently developed to increase the solubility of PTX and to reduce its side effects. Among these investigations, novel multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles as a drug delivery system have received much attention in the recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>EGFR is a cell-surface receptor that is overexpressed in various cancer cells, including the breast, ovaries, bladder, lungs, prostate, and kidneys making it an attractive target for theranostic applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. This receptor has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for targeted drug delivery and PTT <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Meanwhile, owing to their specificity for EGFR overexpressing tumor cells, monoclonal antibodies (anti-EGFR) have been developed as a specific ligand to guide nanocarriers to specifically kill cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody-conjugated and paclitaxel loaded-thiol chitosan-layered gold nanoshells (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) as a multifunctional theranostic agent has attracted increasing attention for the first time, used for NIR laser-triggered drug release in combined chemophotothermal therapy under the guidance of PAI, because of their excellent biosafety, biocompatibility, stability, broad NIR absorbance, photothermal stability, high drug loading capabilities, fast and laser irradiation-controllable drug release, and high targeting efficiency. In this work, we report the use of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs as a theranostic agent for fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) dual-modal imaging-guided chemophotothermal synergistic therapy.</p></div>

Silica cores (120 nm) were synthesized using the Stöber method <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. For GNS layer formation, the silica cores were coated with gold colloids (~9 nm) synthesized by following an earlier reported method <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. For the depolymerization of CS, 1 g of CS (MW: 50-190 kDa, 85% deacetylation degree) fully dissolved in 2% acetic acid solution (100 mL), and CS were prepared according to the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. CS was freeze-dried and stored for further use.</p><p>For the surface coating of GNSs, 1.0 g of CS was fully dissolved in 25 mL of deionized water (DW), and the free amino groups of CS were reacted with the carboxyl groups of dithiol ligands such as lipoic acid (LA; 0.247 g, 2.4 mM) through a coupling reaction in the presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC•HCl; 0.288 g, 3 mM) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium (sulfo-NHS; 0.651 g, 6 mM) for 24 h at room temperature and CS-LA (TCS) was then freeze-dried <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Thiol chitosan (TCS; 1 mg/mL) was added to 20 mL of GNSs through gold-thiol interaction for 24 h at room temperature. The TCS-layered GNSs (TCS-GNSs) were purified by certification, washed three times in DW to remove unreacted TCS, and then freeze-dried.</p><p>PTX loaded onto TCS-GNSs was synthesized according to earlier reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. 1.155 g of TCS-GNSs and 0.79 g of 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid (DTPA; 15.6 mM) were completely dissolved in 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), followed by adding trimethylamine (0.79 g, 15.6 mM) in the mixture solution and then stirring at ambient temperature overnight. DTPA-TCS-GNSs were prepared via a condensation reaction between PTX and DTPA-TCS-GNSs using dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as a catalytic agent and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) as a condensing agent. Briefly, 0.44 g of DTPA-TCS-GNSs, 0.128 g of PTX (0.3 mM), and 18 mg of DMAP were dissolved in 5 mL of DMF for 12 h and then 0.075 g of DIC was added to the reaction solution. The reaction solution was then stirred at ambient temperature overnight, and the solution was dialyzed against DMF to remove unbound molecules. PTX-TCS-GNSs were then freeze-dried and stored for further use.</p><p>For the conjugation of anti-EGFR antibodies on the surface of PTX-TCS-GNSs, 5 μL of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody solution was dissolved in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with EDC/NHS (1 mg, 0.005 mM) for 30 min at ambient temperature. Free amino groups of PTX-TCS-GNSs (0.5 mg) were added to the reaction solution and stirred at ambient temperature for 16 h. The anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNS solutions were centrifuged, washed with PBS, redispersed in PBS, and then freeze-dried. The antibody conjugation efficiency was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The degree of amino acid substitution was measured using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Characterization</head><p>The structural and chemical composition and the size of the nanomaterials were characterized using field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM, Model JEM-2100F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) attached to the FETEM. Imaging of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was performed in the highangle annular dark-field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode and EDX mappings were obtained in STEM mode (Model TEM 2010F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The absorbance spectra were determined using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Genesys 30S; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and surface zeta potential (ZP) of the nanomaterials were measured using an electrophoretic light scattering spectrophotometer (ELS-8000; Otsuka Electronics Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were characterized with a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The chemical structures of CS, LA, and TCS were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra ( 1 H NMR), and the 1 H NMR spectra were recorded in D 2 O on a JNM ECP-400 spectrometer (400 MHz; JEOL, Japan). Thermogravimetric analysis curves were investigated using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond TG/DTA thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer (USA). The gold (Au) ion concentration of the nanomaterials was quantified by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS; PerkinElmer-NexION 300D, PerkinElmer Corporation, USA). An NIR laser at 808 nm (Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology, Changchun, China) was used to conduct the photothermal experiments, and the thermographs were recorded using a digital IR thermal imaging camera (FLIR Systems Inc., Portland, USA). The stability of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was determined using a UV-vis spectrophotometer, FETEM, DLS, and ZP at room temperature for 12 days in DW or PBS.</p><p>In vivo fluorescent imaging experiments were performed using a customized NIR reflection mode fluorescent imaging system. A complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera (GS3-U3-41C6NIR-C; Point Grey Research, USA) with a camera lens (AC254-040-B; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA) was employed to acquire all fluorescent images. We chose a group of filters to detect the IR783 fluorescent contrast agent: an emission filter (FF01-832/37-25; Semrock, Rochester, NY, USA), an excitation filter (FF01-769/41-25; Semrock), and a dichroic mirror (FF801-Di02-25 × 36; Semrock). A 780-nm highpower light-emitting diode (LED) (M780L3; Thorlabs) was used for irradiation for the excitation light, which was collimated using an aspheric condenser lens (ACL2520U; Thorlabs). The FlyCapture2 software version 2.13 (Point Grey Research) was used to perform the image acquisition. Finally, in order to handle the fluorescent images, we used ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p><p>A photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) system was used a Q-switched diode-pumped solid-state laser (SPOT-10-100-532; Elforlight, Daventry, UK) as an excitation source. The laser operated at a repetition rate of 5 kHz with a wavelength of 532 nm and the pulsed duration of 1.8 ns. The laser light was alternately coupling into two fibers, that is, a 2 m single-mode fiber (P3-460B-FC-2; Thorlabs, USA) and one 35 m polarization-maintaining fiber (PM-S405-XP; Nufern, East Granby, CT, USA) by two fiber couplers and variable beam splitters. The output laser light of two fibers was excited the sample to produce PA waves with the energy density under 13.3 mJ/cm 2 . A home-made acoustic and optical beam combiner (OABC) was made to maximize the PA signals. A threeaxis linear motor was used to bidirectionally scan the OABC to build a volumetric image. The generated PA signals were then collected by a focused transducer (V324-SM; Olympus, USA) with a center frequency of 25 MHz. The signals were magnified by two preamplifiers (ZFL-500LN; Mini-Circuits, Brooklyn, NY, USA), and finally were acquired by a high-speed digitizer (NI PXI-5124; National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). Data were processed to form PA images using MATLAB software. Then, the processed data were used to build a 3D image using Amira software (version 5.2.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></div>

The in vitro cytotoxicity of the GNSs, TCS-GNSs, free PTX, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The HeLa cells and MDA-MB-231 cells (10,000 cells/well) were cultured on a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h. Afterwards, the cells were cultured with GNSs, TCS-GNSs, free PTX, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs at different concentrations of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, and 250 μg/mL for 24 h.

GNSs were synthesized using the modified Oldenburg method <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and the amino groups present in the CS were conjugated with carboxyl groups located on dithiol ligands such as LA, through carbodiimide chemistry (TCS). The decoration of GNSs with TCS was successfully synthesized through covalent gold-thiol linkages (TCS-GNSs). PTX was directly conjugated to the free amino groups present in the TCS via a condensation reaction (PTX-TCS-GNSs). Finally, the anti-EGFR antibody was covalently conjugated to the free amino groups present in the TCS (PTX-TCS-GNSs) through carbodiimide chemistry in a buffer solution (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs). According to the BCA protein assay, the antibody conjugation efficiency was determined to be 74.58%, suggesting that the antibody was successfully conjugated <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. The free PTX solution was recorded by UV-vis spectrophotometer and it showed the maximum peak at 228 nm (Fig. S3). The free PTX solution did not show any peak in the 300-900 nm. The UV-vis-NIR spectra revealed that the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks for GNSs, TCS-GNSs, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs showed strong absorbance in the NIR region (700-1200 nm), and they showed an SPR absorption peak at 799 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Therefore, the surface of the GNSs was decorated by TCS, a biocompatible polymer. The TCS modification did not affect the SPR absorption peak of GNSs, which could greatly improve the colloidal stability. You et al. demonstrated that the SPR peaks at 800 nm for hollow gold nanospheres (HAuNSs) and polyethylene-glycol-(PEG) coated HAuNSs were tuned to the NIR region <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>FETEM images show the structure of the silica core, GNSs, TCS-GNSs, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (Figs. S4-S8 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The silica core has an average diameter of ~120 nm and an average GNS thickness of ~9 nm. Similar results have reported by Norregaard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> demonstrating that the gold nanoshells contain a silica core of 120 nm in diameter surrounded by a 15 nm thick gold shell. After surface modification of GNSs, the TCS with a thickness of ~4 nm was uniformly covered around the surface of the GNSs (TCS-GNSs). After loading with PTX, PTX-TCS-GNSs showed a uniform morphology with a thickness of ~6 nm. After anti-EGFR conjugation with PTX-TCS-GNSs, anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs showed a faint layer surrounding the darker GNSs with a thickness of ~7 nm. Our FETEM images were similar to the previous report using doxorubicin-loaded PEG-hollow gold nanospheres (DOX@PEG-HAuNS), which clearly showed a DOX layer with a thickness of about 4-6 nm covering the surface of DOX@PEG-HAuNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The FETEM and corresponding EDX spectrum of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was used to further confirm the formation of the silicon (Si) and gold (Au) nanoshells. It showed that the strong Au, Si, C, and O signal appeared in the EDX spectrum of the product (Fig. S9a,b). Furthermore, the EDX map for Au, Si, C, and O was observed to demonstrate the presence of four elements in anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (Fig. S10). The EDX mapping images clearly demonstrate that the formation of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs wherein Au (green color) was distributed in the outer layers and the inner Si (orange color) was distributed annularly along with the outer GNSs. In addition, the morphologies of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were further confirmed by HAADF-STEM, which showed a uniform morphology (Fig. S11). A HAADF-STEM-EDX mapping shows the presence of Au, Si, C, and O and confirmed the presence of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (Fig. S12). Similar results were observed by You et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. The size distributions of GNSs, TCS-GNSs, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were determined by DLS to be approximately 128.37 ± 3.41 nm, 133.11 ± 2.52 nm, 134.82 ± 1.48 nm, and 135.98 ± 2.36 nm, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). In addition, GNSs were negatively charged with a zeta potential (ZP) of -41.36 ± 2.06 mV in a PBS (pH 7.4) solution, and TCS, TCS-GNSs, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were positively charged with an effective ZP of +36.21 ± 1.81 mV, +45.24 ± 2.26 mV, +48.51 ± 4.42 mV, and + 49.87 ± 3.49 mV, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref> shows the FTIR spectra of GNSs, CS, TCS, TCS-GNSs, PTX, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs. GNSs showed a peak at 1151 cm -1 and 788 cm -1 , corresponding to the Si-O-Si bond, and a peak at 946 cm -1 corresponding to the Si-OH bond. CS showed some characteristic peaks at 1645 cm -1 , 1570 cm -1 , 1179 cm -1 , and 1030 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the C]O, NeH, CeOeC, and CeO bonds, respectively. After surface modification of GNSs with TCS, the characteristic peak of the TCS was present at 1570 cm -1 , corresponding to the NeH bond, and the major peaks of GNSs appeared at 1151 cm -1 , corresponding to the SieOeSi asymmetric vibration. These peaks confirm the successful formation of TCS-GNSs. The PTX revealed stretching regions for CeC at 1664 cm -1 , for CeN at 1263 cm -1 , and for CeO at 1083 cm -1 . After loading with PTX, the spectrum of the PTX on the TCS-GNSs exhibited peaks of PTX that shifted from 1664 cm -1 , 1263 cm -1 , and 1083 cm -1 to 1682 cm -1 , 1272 cm -1 , and 1086 cm -1 , respectively, and the characteristic peaks of TCS-GNSs appeared, indicating that PTX was successfully loaded into TCS-GNSs (PTX-TCS-GNSs). After anti-EGFR conjugation with PTX-TCS-GNSs, the characteristic peaks of PTX-TCS-GNSs appeared and the major peak associated with the anti-EGFR antibody at 1710 cm -1 was present on anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs, suggesting that the anti-EGFR conjugated at the surface of PTX-TCS-GNSs through the amide linkages. Similar results were observed by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> and Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The chemical structures of CS, LA, and TCS were further confirmed by the <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>H NMR spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S13</ref>). The spectrum for CS exhibited peaks for the methyl, ethyl, and sugar protons of the structure between 1.8 and 3.8 ppm. The proton peaks in the LA were observed at 1.2-1.6, 1.8, 2.2–2.8, 3.1, and 3.6 ppm. Compared with CS and LA, new proton peaks in TCS appeared at 0.9–2.4, 2.7–3.2, and 3.4–3.8 ppm, suggesting that TCS was successfully synthesized. Similar results have reported by Elsaid et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. According to the TNBS method, the degree of amino substitution of TCS (TCS-GNSs), DTPA-TCS (PTX-TCS-GNSs), and anti-EGFR-TCS (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) were determined to be 23.7%, 18.4%, and 15.2% indicating that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was successfully conjugated <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Thermal stability of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was investigated using a TG/DTA and the obtained results presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S14</ref>. The anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was heated from room temperature to 800 °C with an increment of 10 °C/min in air atmosphere. The TG curves show that first weight loss (10%) was observed at 70 °C, suggesting that the excess water molecules started to evaporate from the sample. The second mass loss (30%) was observed from 100 °C-250 °C, the third mass loss (56%) was observed from 250 °C-350 °C, and the fourth mass loss (79%) was observed from 350 °C-580 °C, which could be attributed to the removal of organic matter. Above 580 °C to 800 °C, the TG curve is straight and linear, suggesting no weight loss in the sample. In the DTA curve, two exothermic peaks at 327 °C and 547 °C were observed and two endothermic peaks at 55 °C and 482 °C, which may be related to evaporate the excess water along with decompositions of inorganic matter. Our TG/DTA result is similar to those in previous results and major peaks were observed in a different place due to the use of various reagents in their synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>.</p><p>The stability of nanomaterials in a biosystem is essential, especially in biomedical applications. Anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were dispersed in DW and PBS (pH 7.4) for 12 days and the optical property of the  aqueous dispersion of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was characterized using UV-vis spectrophotometer. As shown in Fig. S15a,b, no obvious difference was observed in DW and PBS for 5 min and 12 days, indicating that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were more stable. The FETEM image of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs shows a uniform morphology in PBS buffer after 12 days (Fig. S16). In addition, the size of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs in the PBS buffer before and after 12 days was characterized by DLS approximately to be 135.98 ± 2.36 nm and 134.21 ± 1.83 nm, respectively. The ZP of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs in the PBS buffer before and after 12 days was determined to be +49.87 ± 3.49 mV and +49.03 ± 4.52 mV, respectively.

Anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs showed strong NIR absorption, a high optical transparency window, whereas blood, water, and biological tissue absorb minimally (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>). The photothermal performance of aqueous solutions of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs at different concentrations (100, 125, 150, and 175 μg/mL) were added in a single well of a 12-well plate and exposed to the 808 nm laser source at a density of 0.3 W/cm 2 (Fig. S17a), 0.6 W/cm 2 (Fig. S17b), 0.9 W/cm 2 (Fig. S17c), and 1.2 W/cm 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) for 300 s. In particular, the temperature of the aqueous anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs solution (175 μg/mL) increased to 52.7 °C after continuous irradiation at 1.2 W/cm 2 for 300 s, which is sufficient for in vivo cancer therapy because tumor cells can be selectively killed at a temperature above that of hyperthermia (42-47 °C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. By contrast, insufficient heating with a temperature increase of only 29.1 °C was recorded for DW, suggesting that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs are a promising material for PTT. In addition, the temperature of the aqueous anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs solution (175 μg/mL) was exposed to the 808 nm laser source at four different powers (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 W/ cm 2 ) for 300 s, resulting in the temperature values of 37.6 °C, 41.2 °C, 46.4 °C, and 52.7 °C, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). The photothermal performance of aqueous anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs solutions was further investigated using an IR thermal camera. The temperature changes of the aqueous anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs solution (175 μg/mL) under 808 nm laser exposure of 0.3 W/cm 2 , 0.6 W/cm 2 , 0.9 W/cm 2 , and 1.2 W/cm 2 for 300 s were captured using an IR thermal camera (Fig. S18).</p><p>The photothermal conversion efficiency plays a significant role in the PTT of nanomaterials <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. To evaluate the photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs aqueous solution, the solution (175 μg/mL) was exposed to the 808 nm laser source at 1.2 W/cm 2 for 300 s. The laser was turned on for about 300 s in each cycle, and then it was turned off for about 900 s in each cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). Afterward, the aqueous solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, which can be shown in a typical photothermal profile (Fig. S19). The value of t s was 292.3 s. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated to be 32.63% from the equation, indicating that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs have excellent photothermal conversion ability, which significantly exceeded those of classic photothermal agents including, gold nanorods (21%) and Cu 2-x S nanocrystals (16.3%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>.

As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, no obvious changes in the temperature were recorded for anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (175 μg/mL) after five cycles of laser on/laser off.

The optical property of the aqueous anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs solution was further characterized using a UV-vis spectrophotometer before and after continuous irradiation of five cycles and the UV-vis-NIR spectra showed no observable changes in the absorbance after continuous irradiation (Fig. S20). The FETEM image also indicates that the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs showed a uniform size after continuous irradiation for five cycles (Fig. S21).

At pH 7.4, the PTX release from anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was extremely slow at 48 h from 15.87% to 23.89% under laser irradiation. These results indicate that acidic conditions and laser irradiation facilitate PTX release from the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs, showing that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs are excellent candidates for drug delivery applications. Similar results have also been reported by Ren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> suggesting that both acidic conditions and heating induced by NIR laser could facilitate PTX release from the nano-drugs, which is suitable for drug's controllable release regulated by the pH value and NIR light.</p><p>The PTX release from anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs triggered by NIR laser was further investigated at pH 5.0. The PTX release was 14.34% from anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs at 6 h at pH 5.0 without laser irradiation, whereas at the same treatment conditions, the release of PTX was significantly increased to 25.14% when anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were exposed to an 808 nm laser source at 1.2 W/cm 2 for 300 s and the release of PTX was very slow once the NIR laser was switched off for the next hour (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>). After an additional four cycles of laser on for 300 s at 12 h, 18 h, 30 h, and 42 h, the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs exhibited 91.09% drug release up to 48 h, much higher than that the PTX was released of 53.83% at 48 h without irradiation, suggesting that apart from the acidic conditions, NIR laser-induced heat can function as an inducement to laser on-off control the release of PTX from anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. As previously reported, PTX was released more and fast at pH 5.0 and about 81.2% of PTX was released at 48 h after four cycles of 5 min laser irradiation because of the heat generated by graphene oxide when absorbing NIR light, which weakens the noncovalent absorption interactions between PTX and graphene oxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">In vitro cytotoxicity and hemolysis studies</head><p>The in vitro cytotoxicity of the GNSs, TCS-GNSs, free PTX, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was assessed in the HeLa cells and MDA-MB-231 cells using the MTT assay. The HeLa cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with GNSs, TCS-GNSs, free PTX, PTX-TCS-GNSs and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs at different concentrations 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, and 250 μg/mL for 24 h. The viabilities of the HeLa cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were found to be above 71% at a high concentration of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs up to 250 μg/mL for 24 h, exhibiting a relatively low toxicity to cancer cells (Fig. S22 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). These results indicate that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs have very low toxicity to cancer cells and tissues. As shown in Fig. S22 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>, no obvious differences were observed above 95% at a high concentration of TCS-GNSs up to 250 μg/mL for 24 h, suggesting that the synthesized TCS-GNSs appear to be largely biocompatible. Lv et al. reported the relative cell viability of A549, B16F1, HeLa, and MCF-7 treated with the 3,3′-dithiodipropionic acid-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(L-lysine) (mPEG-b-P(LL-DTPA)), which were found to be above 85% at a high concentration of mPEG-b-P(LL-DTPA) up to 1000 μg/mL for 48 h, indicating the remarkable safety and biocompatibility of mPEG-b-P(LL-DTPA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. For the in vivo cancer therapy of TCS-GNSs, the hemocompatibility assay is a crucial toxicological factor that must be investigated. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>, TCS-GNSs showed hemolytic activities of 5.21 ± 0.26% at a high concentration of 250 μg/mL, showing the good blood compatibility of the nanomaterials. Similar results have been suggested by Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, polyelectrolyte multilayer functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PEM-MSNs) showed a hemolysis percentage of lower than 1% at a high concentration of PEM-MSNs up to 800 μg/mL, suggesting that PEM-MSN-treated RBCs exhibited no noticeable hemolytic activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">In vitro cellular uptake studies</head><p>The cellular uptake behaviors of TCS-GNSs, PTX-TCS-GNSs, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs in MDA-MB-231 cells were quantified by an ICP-MS. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>, the intercellular uptake of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs gradually increased as the incubation time increased from 1 h to 5 h and the amount of Au was measured to be 73.35 ± 3.66 pg per cell at 5 h compared to 21.78 ± 1.0 pg per cell for nonspecific TCS-GNSs and 23.46 ± 1.17 pg per cell for nonspecific PTX-TCS-GNSs, suggesting that the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs exhibited enhanced cellular uptake because of their efficient and fast receptormediated endocytosis process <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Similar results have been suggested by Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, the intracellular uptake amount of gold nanocages (AuNCs@DBPP) per cell increased with incubation time from 1 to 8 h, which was higher than that of DOX@AuNCs at the same incubation time, suggesting that biotin receptor-mediated endocytosis could facilitate the cellular uptake of AuNCs@DBPP. Furthermore, the cellular uptake of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were also confirmed by TEM in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S23a). The anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were localized mostly in the endocytotic vesicles and some of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were localized in the nucleus as well as in other cytoplasmic organelles. Similar results were observed by Tiwari et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. In addition, the EDX spectrum of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs collected from intracellular vesicles exhibited the Au signals because of the receptor-mediated endocytosis process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">S23b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">In vitro chemophotothermal therapy</head><p>In order to assess the chemophotothermal efficiency of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs, in vitro cytotoxicity was measured using the MTT assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with a culture medium containing anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs at different concentrations 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 175 μg/mL for 5 h, and then the cells were or were not irradiated at 1.2 W/cm 2 with an 808 nm laser for 300 s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>). After further incubation for 2 h, the cell viability without 808 nm laser irradiation was 81.55% at the highest concentration of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs up to 175 μg/mL, indicating no noticeable effect on the cells. The majority of the cells were killed after being incubated with anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (175 μg/mL) and exposed to an 808 nm laser source at 1.2 W/cm 2 for 300 s, and the cell viability decreased to 20.48%, suggesting that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs have potential as highly efficient PTT nanomaterials for cancer therapy. Furthermore, the cells were treated with a culture medium containing anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (175 μg/mL) for 5 h and the cells were or were not irradiated at a density of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 W/cm 2 with an 808 nm laser for 300 s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>). The cells were efficiently killed by anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs at a concentration of 175 μg/mL with 808 nm laser exposure; &gt; 80% of the cells were killed, suggesting that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs have a significant photothermal effect and may act as an efficient photothermal agent for in vivo cancer treatment. As demonstrated by previous work, the multifunctional Au@carbon/calcium phosphate core-shell nanoparticles (Au@C/CaP NPs) with laser irradiation show relatively higher cell toxicity, suggesting that the combination of the chemo-photothermal therapy of the Au@C/CaP NPs could significantly improve the efficacy of the cancer cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p><p>In order to further identify cell viability, all the groups of MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with calcein-AM and PI for live (green) and dead (red) cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>, Fig. S24, and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). In the control groups, all the cells showed green fluorescence and few dead cells were observed. By contrast, the cells were treated with anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs and then exposed to an 808 nm laser source at 1.2 W/cm 2 for 300 s. The cells exhibited strong red fluorescence, indicating that they were completely killed. As previously reported, fluorescence staining using calcein-AM and PI was investigated for visualization of live and dead cells and the HeLa cells were incubated Au@C/CaP NPs under laser irradiation, a large red area is discovered, indicating that the Au@C/CaP NPs with laser irradiation can effectively kill the cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. In order to further investigate the chemophotothermal efficiency of using a TPFM, all the groups of cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and LysoTracker red and two special fluorescent tracers were used to label the nucleus and lysosomes, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). The cells were treated with anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs under laser irradiation, Hoechst 33342 was clearly observed fragmented nuclei, and the strong red fluorescence signal was mainly distributed within lysosomes, indicating that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs were uptaken via receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway and then more PTX was released from the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs in the lysosomes. In contrast, most of the cells in the control and laser only group showed normal nuclei and free PTX alone, PTX-TCS-GNSs alone, and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs alone showed negligible cell death. These results indicated that the internalized anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs under laser irradiation was delivered to lysosomes where the acidic condition accelerated the release and then promoted the nuclei entrance of PTX, which was consistent with previous results that NIR laser-induced heat by nanomaterials could trigger the endosomal escape of drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. In addition, the cell death induced by anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was further evaluated using a PI/Annexin V staining kit and determined using a flow cytometer (Fig. S25). The anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs + laser-treated cells exhibited an 81.9% apoptosis rate, which was higher than those of free PTX (25.45%), PTX-TCS-GNSs (17.15%), and anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (13.27%), indicating a significant photothermal therapeutic effect of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs under laser irradiation (Fig. S26). Similar results were observed by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, the tumor cells were treated with indocyanine green (ICG)containing mesoporous silica-coated gold nanorods (I-TMSG) and then double-labeled with PI/Annexin V, suggesting that the I-TMSG plus laser irradiation was significantly induced tumor cell necrosis/late apoptosis (72.9%) compared with control groups (12.7%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Photoacoustic imaging</head><p>Recently, PAI has emerged as a rapidly developing noninvasive imaging technology for biomedical applications, which has the capability to analyze the accumulation of nanomaterials in tumors tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>.

For in vitro PAI, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated at various concentrations (125, 150, and 175 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 6 h. After trypsin digestion, the cells were harvested and loaded into a PTFE tube and used for PAI (Fig. S27 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>). As evidenced in Fig. S28a, b, a higher PA signal was detected from the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (175 μg/mL), indicating the ability of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs to act as a new PAI contrast agent.</p><p>For in vivo PAI, the MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing nude mice were injected with 0.1 mL of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (175 μg/mL) intravenously through a single tail vein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>). First, the PAI of the whole tumor region was scanned using the PAM system with laser (wavelength: 532 nm) at 0 h and 6 h after injection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">>e</ref>). The PA signal of hemoglobin levels at 532 nm was generally higher because of the blood vessel and the PA signal of the same area of the tumor at 532 nm was used as a control at 0 h. The PA signal of the same area of the tumor was higher at 6 h after injection by a 532 nm laser compared with control at 0 h, displaying the high targeting efficiency of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs and the great potential of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs for PAI (Supplementary Videos S1 and S2).</p><p>Second, the PAI of the same area of the tumor was scanned by the PAM system with laser (wavelength: 532-1000 nm) at 0 h and 6 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>). The control at 0 h showed a weak PA signal, and the blood vessels in the tumor region were found because of the presence of hemoglobin as an endogenous contrast agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. The anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs-treated mice showed a higher PA signal in the tumor region compared with the control at 0 h. Finally, the PAI of the tumor region was scanned by the PAM system with laser (wavelength: 625-1000 nm) at 0 h and 6 h after injection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>). The tumor showed a very low PA signal at 0 h because of the very low intrinsic absorption of hemoglobin. However, PAI showed a clear tumor microstructure with high contrast and a high spatial resolution at 6 h of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs because of the high NIR absorption in the nanomaterials (Fig. S29), suggesting that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs show a powerful capability to visualize tumors and are a new PAI contrast agent for subsequent chemophotothermal therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.">In vivo fluorescence (FL) imaging and accumulation analysis</head><p>The biodistribution and tumor targeting of nanomaterials labeled with the NIR dye (IR783) in tumor-bearing nude mice were investigated using a whole animal NIR reflection mode fluorescent imaging system. The fluorescence (FL) images of MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing nude mice were obtained at different time points (1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h) after the intravenous injection of IR783/anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>). The fluorescence signals were found in the whole body within 6 h because of the blood flow of IR783 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The fluorescence signals in the tumor region were obviously enhanced within 6 h, and the fluorescence signals were gradually decreased after 6 h, indicating that 6 h after injection was the optimum time period for the in vivo chemophotothermal therapy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>). Our in vivo FL imaging is similar to previous results and IR783/hyaluronic acid-hollow mesoporous copper sulfide nanoparticles (HMCuS-HA NPs) showed highest FL signals in tumor area at about 8 h, suggesting that HMCuS-HA NPs significantly enhanced accumulation in the tumor through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the distribution of IR783/anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was further confirmed by ex vivo imaging at 24 h after injection, and the organs, including the heart, liver, lung, kidney, and spleen, as well as the tumor were excised and analyzed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7d</ref>, the fluorescence signals of IR783/anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs at the tumor region were significantly higher compared with other organs because of the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway, which showed an excellent tumor targeting efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>. In order to further quantitatively measure the in vivo biodistribution of IR783/anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs, the organs and blood of mice were harvested and measured for Au content by an ICP-MS. Interestingly, the amount of Au element in the tumor at 6 h was over 6.28% ID/g (injection dosage per gram of tissue), which was significantly higher than in other organs and in the blood, suggesting a higher tumor targeting efficiency of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7e</ref>). After 24 h, the residual anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs in most of the organs and blood decreased appreciably, suggesting the effective clearance of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs. Similar results were observed by Feng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.">In vivo chemophotothermal therapy</head><p>We have investigated the combination therapy of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs. After the tumor size reached ~100 mm 3 , the MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice were separated into six groups through a single tail vein injection (n = 5 per group). After 5 h of injection, the tumors in the samples of Group II and VI were exposed to an 808 nm laser at a density of 1.2 W/cm 2 for 300 s. The local tumor temperature in the Group II (saline) and Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) samples with laser irradiation was imaged using an IR thermal camera (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8a</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8b</ref>, the local temperature change of the tumor in the Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) samples with laser irradiation increased and reached a very high temperature of 61.9 °C within 300 s, which was highly sufficient to effectively ablate tumors in vivo. As previously reported, the temperature of tumors on mice injected with bacterial magnetic nanoparticles (BMPs) rapidly reached to 57 °C in 3 min, which was sufficient for fast induction of cancer cells necrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. By contrast, the local tumor temperature in the Group II (saline) with laser irradiation reached 34.6 °C, which was insufficient to thermally ablate tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>. After the treatment, no animals died in the groups and no observable differences were observed in the body weights of mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8c</ref>), suggesting that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs have excellent biocompatibility and their photothermal effect did not cause any noticeable toxicity in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. Then, the tumor volume of the mice was measured every two days, and it was found that the tumors grew fast in all control groups of mice during the course of treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8d</ref>).

Notably, the tumors in Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) with laser irradiation were highly ablated and no recurrence was detected, even after 16 more days of feeding. In the previous report, gold assemblies (GAs) could act as an efficient photothermal agent for cancer therapy to fully eliminate tumor in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Furthermore, the survival rates of mice were monitored during the course of treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8e</ref>). The survival rate over 34 days was 100% in Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) with laser irradiation compared with all other groups, suggesting that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs + laser has a good chemophotothermal efficiency and excellent biocompatibility. Previous reports also showed that the BMPs have excellent biocompatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. After the treatment, the tumors were excised (Fig. S31b), and it was found that the tumor weights in Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) with laser irradiation were smaller than in all other groups (Fig. S33).</p><p>In order to further confirm the chemophotothermal effect of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs, histological analysis of tumor cell death was performed by tumor sections using H&amp;E staining and TUNEL staining at 24 h posttreatment. As shown in Fig. S34, significant tumor necrosis, and more apoptotic cells were recorded in Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) with laser irradiation, when compared with all other groups in the tumor showed no or very few apoptotic cells, suggesting that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs injected tumor cells were severely destroyed after laser irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. Previous reports also proved that GA7 injected tumor cells were severely damaged after laser irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. The TUNEL assay was also investigated and a strong green signal was observed in the tumor tissue of Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) with laser irradiation, whereas in all other groups, a very weak green signal was observed, indicating that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs could efficiently inhibit tumor growth after laser irradiation (Fig. S35). The apoptotic tumor cells in Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) with laser irradiation were 42.34% in comparison with all other groups (Fig. S36). After treatment, no tumor tissues were observed in Group VI (anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs) with laser irradiation. Histological analysis of the organs of healthy mice was performed after 16 days after treatment, and no observable histopathological abnormalities or inflammation was observed (Fig. S37), indicating that anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs with laser irradiation are highly effective photothermal agents for tumor therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Furthermore, the biodistribution of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs with laser irradiation was analyzed after 24 h and 16 days posttreatment by an ICP-MS. As evidenced in Fig. S38, the amount of Au element in the tumor within 24 h after injection was calculated to be 5.03% ID/g, which is much larger than that for all other organs, and no tumor tissues were observed in anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs with laser irradiation 16 days after treatment, showing a safe and a higher targeting efficiency of the anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In this study, a novel multifunctional theranostic agent, anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs was developed for the first time and used for NIR laser-triggered drug release in combined chemophotothermal therapy under the guidance of PAI. Anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs showed excellent biocompatibility, biosafety, stability, photostability, broad NIR absorbance, and high targeting efficiency. In addition, anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs exhibited high drug loading capabilities, pH and NIR laser dualresponsive chemotherapy, and high photothermal conversion efficiency, demonstrating that chemophotothermal synergistic therapy with PAI is highly efficient for the treatment of cancer. The in vitro cancer cells ablation efficiency was significantly reduced after laser irradiation. Notably, the in vivo chemophotothermal treatment of anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs with laser irradiation was highly ablated and no recurrence was detected. Anti-EGFR-PTX-TCS-GNSs exhibited high biosafety with excellent biocompatibility as confirmed by histopathological analyses. In future, understanding the molecular mechanisms of cancer therapy is very important and more extensive animal experimentation and well-controlled clinical trials are needed for further studies. We believe that this work will provide a new concept and strategy for the development of a novel multifunctional nanotheranostic agent for future clinical applications in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer.</p><p>Supplementary data to this article can be found online at <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.08.007">https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2019.08.007</ref>.</p></div>
