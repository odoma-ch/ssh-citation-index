<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We show that Weinberg's leading soft photon theorem in massless abelian gauge theories implies the existence of an infinite-dimensional large gauge symmetry which acts non-trivially on the null boundaries I ± of (d + 2)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. These symmetries are parameterized by an arbitrary function ε(x) of the d-dimensional celestial sphere living at I ± .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Soft theorems are equations that describe how scattering amplitudes in Minkowski spacetime involving one or many low energy, or soft, massless particles factorizes into a term involving the soft gauge particles (known as the soft factor) and one involving the amplitude without the soft particles, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">A n m soft particles ---------→ S m A n-m ,<label>(1.1)</label></formula><p>where S m is the soft factor involving m soft particles. Such theorems were established over half a century ago in the works of Bloch, Nordseick, Low, Yennie, Frautschi, Suura <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and in a more modern language by Weinberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. A particularly interesting feature of all the soft theorems is that the soft factor is universal, i.e. it does not depend on the details of the theory under consideration. Rather, it depends only on the quantum numbers (linear momenta, angular momenta and charges) of the external particles involved in the scattering amplitude. Such universality naturally suggests that perhaps the soft theorems arise from some underlying symmetry, and indeed, it was relatively recently discovered that these theorems are precisely the Ward identities associated to the asymptotic symmetries of scattering amplitudes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for a review and a comprehensive list of references).</p><p>Largely in part due to this discovery, in the last several years, there has been a resurgence of activity in the study of soft theorems, and many interesting directions have been explored. The equivalence was originally conceived for four-dimensional theories where it has been established to hold for gauge theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, gravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, as well as their supersymmetric counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The equivalence has proved useful in the exploration of not just the original soft theorems, but also new subleading and sub-subleading soft theorems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Some of these were discovered by studying known asymptotic symmetries <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> while others led to the discovery of new asymptotic symmetries <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Finally, this equivalence has also been extended to theories living in higher even dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, which is certainly relevant in the context of string theory.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> </p><p>The plethora of successes in these endeavors has given confidence that perhaps every soft theorem in Minkowski spacetime can be interpreted as the Ward identity for some asymptotic symmetry. However, there is a noticeable class of theories in which the bridge between soft theorems and asymptotic symmetries is missing -these are theories in odd spacetime dimensions. Soft theorems are true and have the same universal form in both even and odd dimensions.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> Yet, to our knowledge, there has been no successful attempt in showing the equivalence of soft theorems and asymptotic symmetries in odd dimensional theories. The fundamental issue lies in the qualitatively different properties of massless waves in even and odd dimensions. For instance, the massless Green's function is supported entirely on the light cone in even dimensions, whereas in odd dimensions it is supported everywhere inside the lightcone <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. This implies that for a complete understanding of waves in odd dimensions, one needs to study timelike infinity i ± as well as null infinity I ± . Another symptom of the same feature is that the near I ± expansions of massless fields is analytic in even dimensions (i.e. admits a Taylor series expansion in r -1 where r is the radius of the transverse sphere) and non-analytic in odd dimensions. These issues make the discussion of asymptotic symmetries particularly difficult in odd dimensions. Despite this, it would be very strange if no such relationship exists, implying that soft theorems in odd dimensions have a wholly different origin than those in even dimensions.</p><p>In this paper, we resolve the issues discussed in the previous paragraph and show that, at least in the simple example of a U(1) gauge theory with massless charged matter, the leading soft photon theorem is the Ward identity associated to large gauge symmetry in all dimensions, thereby unifying and generalizing the previous discussions from four and higher even dimensions to all dimensions. We organize the paper so that in section 2, we study U(1) gauge theories in d + 2 dimensions and discuss asymptotic fall-offs of both free and interacting gauge fields. In section 3, we impose a matching condition across spatial infinity i 0 and demonstrate that the resulting Ward identity implies the leading soft photon theorem. Finally, in section 4, we show that the matching condition implies conservation of a charge which generates large gauge transformations on the fields at I ± .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 Position space</head><p>In this subsection, we will gain some intuition regarding the flat null coordinates utilized throughout this paper by collecting miscellaneous facts about them. Flat null coordinates x µ = (u, x a , r) are related to Cartesian coordinates X A via</p><p>The inverse relation is</p><p>Though the coordinates are ill-defined on the hypersurface X 0 + X d+1 = 0 where r = 0, away from this point, the metric is well defined and takes the form</p><p>where η AB = (-1, 1, . . . , 1) is the usual Minkowski metric in Cartesian coordinates. The range of the coordinates is</p><p>We note</p><p>and</p><p>The volume form is</p><p>The nonvanishing metric components and its inverse are</p><p>The nonvanishing Christoffel symbols are</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1.1 Boundaries of Minkowski spacetime</head><p>To determine the location of the boundaries of Minkowski spacetime in flat null coordinates, we relate them to Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (U, V, λ, Θ), which are</p><p>Note that the radial distance is simply expressed as R ≡ X a X a + X d+1 2 = V -U 2 . The coordinate ranges are</p><p>Together, the coordinates (λ, Θ) parametrize S d . λ ∈ (0, 1) is the northern hemisphere and λ ∈ (-1, 0) is the southern hemisphere. λ = 0 is the equator, λ = +1 is the north pole and λ = -1 is the south pole. Let λ ap , Θ ap be the antipodal point to (λ, Θ). Then</p><p>Furthermore, in terms of the flat null coordinates, we have</p><p>We can now determine the boundaries of Minkowski spacetime in flat null coordinates.</p><p>1. Future null infinity I + : this is located at V → +∞ while keeping (U, λ, Θ) fixed. In this limit,</p><p>Thus, we find that I + is located at r → ∞. At this point, x a are the stereographic coordinates on S d . The north pole (λ = 1) is at |x a | = 0, the south pole (λ = -1) is at |x a | = ∞, and the equator (λ = 0) is on the unit circle x a x a = 1. u is the null generator of this surface.</p><p>2. Past null infinity I -: this is located at U → -∞ while keeping (V, λ, Θ) fixed. In this limit,</p><p>Thus, we find that I -is located at r → -∞. Again, x a are the stereographic coordinates on S d , but now with an antipodal identification. The north pole (λ = 1) is at |x a | = ∞, the south pole (λ = -1) is at |x a | = 0, and the equator (λ = 0) is on the unit circle x a x a = 1. u is the null generator of this surface.</p><p>3. Future timelike infinity i + : this is located at X 0 → +∞ while keeping (R, λ, Θ) fixed. In this limit,</p><p>Thus, we find that i + located at u, r → ∞ and x a → 0 while keeping u -r and rx a fixed.</p><p>4. Past timelike infinity i -: this is located at X 0 → -∞ while keeping (R, λ, Θ) fixed. In this limit,</p><p>Thus, we find that i -located at u, r → -∞ and x a → 0 while keeping u -r and rx a fixed.</p><p>5. Spatial infinity i 0 : this is located at R → +∞ while keeping (X 0 , λ, Θ) fixed. In this limit,</p><p>This limit corresponds to ur → -∞ while keeping u r and x a fixed. In particular, on the northern hemisphere, we take u → -∞ and r → +∞, whereas on the southern hemisphere, we take u → +∞ and r → -∞.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1.2 Isometries</head><p>The isometries of R 1,d+1 are the d + 2 translations and the O(1, d + 1) rotations. The corresponding Killing vectors in flat null coordinates are</p><p>where ψ(x) = 1 d ∂ a Y a (x), and f (x) and Y a (x) satisfy the equations</p><p>This implies that Y a (x) is the conformal Killing vector of R d (which manifests the isomorphism O(1, d + 1) ∼ = conf(R d )). The explicit solutions to this are</p><p>Thus, ψ(x) = λ -2ζ • x. The O(d) rotations have ψ(x) = 0 (generated by χ a and ω a b ), whereas the boosts in O(1, d + 1) have ψ(x) = 0 (generated by λ and ζ a ). Finally, we remark that the Lie algebra of the Killing vectors (the Poincaré algebra) takes the form</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Momentum space</head><p>In this subsection, we observe a general parameterization of off-shell momenta and list some useful formulae.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2.1 Off-shell momentum</head><p>Following closely the relationship between flat null coordinates and Cartesian coordinates, we parameterize an off-shell momentum as</p><p>Inversely, µ = -q A q A , y a = q a (q 0 + q d+1 ) -1 , and ω = q 0 + q d+1 . This parameterization is valid everywhere except when ω = q 0 + q d+1 = 0. The range of these coordinates is µ ∈ R, y a ∈ R d and ω ∈ R \ {0}. The momentum space volume form is</p><p>This implies that the off-shell integration measure and Dirac delta function are</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2.2 On-shell momentum and polarization vectors</head><p>The on-shell condition on a momentum implies</p><p>The on-shell integration measure and Dirac delta function are</p><p>The d + 1 polarizations of a massive particle are taken to be</p><p>In the massless limit ε A ω → ω -1 q A . Thus, in this limit, this is the pure gauge mode and does not contribute to physical amplitudes. For future reference, we collect the formulae</p><p>We also require the components of the momentum and polarization vectors in flat null coordinates</p><p>For massless vectors, we note from the formulae above that our polarization choice is equivalent to the gauge choice A u = 0. The polarization tensors for the massless field strength then has the following components in flat null coordinates</p><p>where I ab (x -y) is the conformally invariant tensor</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B Action of the hard charge</head><p>In this section, we show that the hard charge generates large gauge transformations on the matter states by an explicit computation for a minimally coupled scalar field Φ with U(1) charge Q ∈ Z. The corresponding conserved current is</p><p>The product of fields is defined via normal ordering.</p><p>The mode expansion for the outgoing/incoming scalar field is</p><p>where</p><p>Moving to flat null coordinates and using ( <ref type="formula">2.14</ref>), we find</p><p>where</p><p>The leading order term in the large r expansion of the scalar field is (this is determined following precisely the method of section 2.2.1)</p><p>We then determine that</p><p>An outgoing or incoming scalar state of charge Q is</p><p>Using these definitions, we find</p><p>The action of the hard charge ( <ref type="formula">3.7</ref>) is then</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C Soft photon operator</head><p>We describe how to obtain the soft photon insertion operator in an S-matrix using the path integral approach. First, the n-point amplitude is</p><p>This is computed in the path integral formalism by computing off-shell momentum space correlators and taking an appropriate on-shell limit. For instance, for an outgoing scalar particle with momentum p, we insert</p><p>Here, Φ(X) is an operator that creates (among other things) a scalar one-particle state, and Z Φ is the corresponding wave-function renormalization factor. The amplitude involving an extra outgoing photon, i.e. A out n+1 from ( <ref type="formula">3.23</ref>), similarly corresponds to the insertion of the operator</p><p>To understand what this operator is in terms of the in and out creation/annihilation operators, we expand the gauge field A A (x) in terms of time-dependent mode coefficients:</p><p>Using this, we find iZ e lim</p><p>where lim X 0 →±∞ O a (X 0 , p γ ) = Z -1 O (±) a ( p γ ). 16 For photons with non-zero energy, the operator O (-) a ( p γ ) annihilates the in vacuum (assuming there are no other incoming photons with the same momentum, i.e. assuming no forward scattering) so that S-matrices with energetic outgoing photons correspond to insertions of O (+) a ( p γ ). On the other hand, owing to ( <ref type="formula">3.10</ref>), O (-,0) a (x) no longer annihilates the vacuum; rather, it creates an incoming soft photon (to be more precise, it produces a new vacuum state). Therefore, it follows that the operator generating the soft limit must include both terms from (C.5) and is given by</p></div>			</div>
