			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There has been an increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke in modern societies because of multiple lifestyle related issues like sedentariness and obesity, alcohol consumption and many more "life-style"factors. The FDA-approved thrombolytics such as Tissue Plasminogen Activator, Streptokinase etc. are used to lyse the clots in thrombotic disorders such as myocardial infarction, stroke etc. but re-occlusion and bleeding that are co-incident to their clinical usage are not addressed. Hence, there is need to develop thrombolytics having properties like increased fibrin clot specificity and thrombin inhibition capability to prevent re-occlusion. In the present work, a fusion protein construct containing two components i.e. Staphylokinase (SAK) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) 4, 5, 6-like domains of human thrombomodulin (THBD) was expressed in Pichia pastoris after genetic optimization. SAK isolated from Staphylococcus aureus is a fibrin-specific plasminogen activator while EGF 4, 5, 6-like domains are reported to be responsible for imparting thrombin inhibition to human thrombomodulin, and therefore, expected could help prevent re-occlusion in the novel construct -SAK_EGF, which is a 43 kDa protein. After expression, it was purified (approx. 13-fold) using two-step purification protocol involving ion-exchange followed by Gel Filtration Chromatography (GFC). The functional characterization including plasminogen activation and thrombin inhibition showed that both the fusion partners viz. SAK and 4,5,6 EGF-like domains retained their respective activities after fusion, confirming it to be a bio-active construct. Thus, this engineered protein could be clinically promising due to the combinatorial effect of fibrin-specific thrombus lysis and prevention of re-occulusion.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>According to the WHO website <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, by 2016, cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of deaths worldwide as these involve the unregulated formation of pathological thrombi (blood clots) in the vascular system that lead to diverse circulatory disorders such as myocardial infarction, ischemic strokes, and lung and leg thromboembolisms.</p><p>The USFDA-approved agents for the treatment of circulatory disorders include Urokinase, pro-urokinase, Streptokinase, and various modified and native versions of TPA such as Tenecteplase, Alteplase and Reteplase <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. All these protein drugs are plasminogen activators, and all operate through a closely similar mechanism wherein cleavage of a ''scissile'' peptide bond between Arg 561-Val 562 residues of plasminogen leads to the formation of its proteolytically activated form, namely plasmin (PN). The PN thus formed acts further on fibrin and results in dissolution of the pathological clot. Although the obstruction is removed, this also causes the release of clot-bound thrombin which, in turn, may lead to an increased level of fibrinopeptide-A and hence poses a major concern for patients who may experience bouts of reocclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Heparin, an anticoagulant, is therefore also used during thrombolytic therapy that acts only on free thrombin as clotbound thrombin is resistant to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. This clot-bound thrombin leads to activation of several factors such as factor V, factor VIII, factor XI, factor XIII, conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, platelets activation, and activation of Thrombin Activable Fibrinolytic Inhibitor (TAFI) which leads to clot formation at some other site <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. It has been documented that human thrombomodulin (THBD) can inhibit the clotbound thrombin by forming a complex with it and converts its function from pro-coagulant to anti-coagulant <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</p><p>In an attempt to prevent the serious, re-occulusion problem, during thrombolytic therapy, we designed a molecule comprising two activities from two heterologous proteins by the formation of a fusion/chimeric protein. For this, a reasonably well tested fibrin-specific plasminogen activator i.e. Staphylokinase (SAK) and the 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains of THBD were selected for fusion.</p><p>SAK, one of the well-known bacterial plasminogen activators, was originally isolated from a lysogenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus; it is fibrin specific and results in clot dissolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. SAK forms a 1:1 complex with human plasmin (HPN) which further leads to cleavage of its substrate, human plasminogen (HPG) into HPN. The α 2 antiplasmin present in circulating plasma rapidly inhibits unbound SAK.HPN complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> whereas fibrin-bound complex is resistant to α 2 antiplasmin inhibition, leading to its fibrin specificity and fibrinogen protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Human THBD forms a 1:1 M complex with thrombin, and this complex is an activator of the Protein C pathway. It is a 72 kDa protein and is associated with endothelial cell surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and consists of five distinct domains: N-terminal domain (1-226 residues); a cysteinerich region containing EGF (Epidermal Growth factor) 4, 5, 6-like type B repeats (residues 226-462); an O-glycosylated Ser/Thr rich region (residues 463-497); a hydrophobic transmembrane region (498-521 residues); and a C-terminal cytoplasmic "tail" (residues 522-557) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Earlier reports suggested that 4, 5, 6 EGF -like domains have a great therapeutic potential due to their thrombin inhibition and Protein C activation capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</p><p>In the present work, the SAK DNA encoding translational Open Reading Frame (ORF) has been fused that of 4, 5, 6 Epidermal Growth Factor-like domains (EGF) of THBD co-translationally with its C-terminal so as to express a chimeric polypeptide in Pichia pastoris. The purification of SAK_EGF was optimized to a simple, two-step chromatography scheme using ion-exchange chromatography with Q-Sepharose (Fast flow) followed by Gel Filtration Chromatography (GFC) with Superdex-75.</p></div>

Fractions obtained from Q-Sepharose (Fast flow) were run on SDS-PAGE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). The results showed the fractions with a molecular mass of 43 kDa. These fractions corresponded to the encircled region on the main peak (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). These fractions were pooled and subjected to 2nd step purification using Superdex 75 pg column. In this purification, two peaks were obtained so collected separately (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 c</ref>) and fractions collected were run on SDS gel.

In one approach, tunicamycin antibiotic was used during induction phase to inhibit glycosylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> and in another Pichia optimized codons of SAK were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. In the present study, the key residue of Thr-30, a site for N-linked glycosylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, was mutated to Ala, to get functional SAK in Pichia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. While in 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains of THBD it is reported that oxidation of Met 388 reduces the cofactor actvity of THBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, so to improve the anticoagulant activity of THBD domains Met was subsituted with Leu <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>In literature, attempts to equip SAK with bifunctional property have been reported which include fusion of SAK having plasminogen-activation and other functions including thrombin inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, antiplatelet activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, and increased fibrin specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58]</ref>. Currently, there is no report of FDA approved thromobolytic fusion protein with EGF like properties relevant to anti thrombin via both direct inhibition as well as prevention of re-occlusion through the pro-coagulant "pathway". However, in literature the FDA-approved anti-thrombin -dabigatran which is a hirudin analog, and antiplatelet drugs -Aspirin, Ticlopidine, Clopidogre etc. are mentioned to be used as adjuvants during thrombolytic therapy; however these have been reported to cause increased bleeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Hence, the present design of a C-terminal fusion of SAK and 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains of THBD that results in fibrin-specific clot dissolution (derived from SAK) and ability to complex with clot bound thrombin thus inhibiting it from clot formation and also inhibiting factors like Va, VIIa involved in thrombin generation through Protein C activation pathway represents a potential opening for a new analog with promise.</p><p>The fusion of Streptokinase (SK) with 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains of THBD has also been reported in earlier studies from our lab where it was shown that both the fusion partners retained their individual activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. However, the structure and functional correlations in SK which is three-domain protein different in size as well as complexity of interaction with human plasminogen than the single-domain SAK where the probability of compromising function during a fusion could be argued to be greater <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>. SK, it may be mentioned, intrinsically does not possess high fibrin specificity in its action, unlike SAK <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Therefore, the co-existence of fibrin specificity, low molecular size (SK is a 47 kDa, and SAK a 16 kDa protein) leading to greater penetration of clots, along with thrombin inhibition make a SAK-EGF chimeric construct of special attraction for clinical applications especially in ischemic strokes where re-occlusion can be observed in a majority of cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</p><p>In this present study, we have shown the successful formation of a stable C-terminal chimera of 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains of THBD with SAK. As far as the bioactivity of both fusion segments are concerned, SAK_EGF retained plasminogen activation whereas the integrated 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains also successfully inhibited thrombin which resulted in the doubling of clotting time in presence of different concentration of SAK_EGF. This is the first report wherein SAK has been 'equipped' with an integrated anti-thrombin function by a simple fusion with 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains of THBD without any major reduction in its core, PG activating function.</p><p>The process for a scaled-up production of the hybrid protein commensurate with pre-clinical, animal model studies so as to target clots in stroke and other circulatory diseases where re-occlusion is a major clinical issue, together with an uncompromised high fibrin-specificity of SAK represents, in our view, a major potential development for therapeutic applications in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this study, we have successfully expressed and purified a novel fusion construct namely SAK_EGF to near-homogeneity. The biochemical and functional characterization of the chimeric protein shows that activity of both partners have been retained after fusion i.e. plasminogen activation activity in case of SAK, and a doubling of clotting time due to inhibition of thrombin by 4, 5, 6 EGF-like domains the THBDindicating a highly optimistic scenario for clot dissolution therapy in the future. </p></div>
