<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To ensure long-term availability of mobility and to keep the effects of humanity on global climate limited, politics, research, and industry currently search for ways to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by it. A potential reduction could be achieved by transitioning towards more efficient transport modes, optimally powered by renewable energy. Based on mobility (commutes), population, and weather data from Switzerland, we present a model to compute energy savings due to a (hypothetical) widespread deployment of electric bicycles. In different scenarios, we analyze the dependence of the commuting energy demand on users' preferences about when to take the bike, such as an aversion to biking on cold and rainy days. Our study shows that GHG emission reductions of up to approx. 10% of the total emissions from diesel and gasoline are possible. In combination with a widespread deployment of electric vehicles, further savings of up to 17.5% could be achieved. In particular, the willingness to drive longer commutes by e-bike influences the potential GHG emission reductions, followed by the willingness to use the bicycle at temperatures below 10°C. Using these results, we identify the spatial energy and greenhouse gas savings potential and thus regions that are particularly suited for e-bike use. The identification of regions with high saving potentials allows for targeted marketing, transition-supporting incentives, or infrastructural changes to maximize the reduction of emissions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In-depth research and intensive political discussions on the environmental impact of humanity in recent years lead to increased efforts in keeping human-caused effects on climate and environment minimal. Many countries formulated challenging goals for reducing green house gas (GHG) emissions, and intend to invest large sums in renewable energies. For example, the Swiss government formulated the Energy Strategy 2050, which aims at increasing the electricity production from renewable energy sources by 14.5 TWh until 2035 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which is an increase of 39.7% compared to 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. On an international level, the sustainable development goals of the United Nations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> include a reduction of global GHG emissions by 50-80% until 2050.</p><p>Along the same lines, the 2000-Watt Society proposes that every citizen should have a maximal total energy consumption of 2000 W on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, resp. a maximal CO 2 emission of 1 ton per year. 36.4% of the total energy demand in Switzerland comes from mobility, a number that hints at the large energy saving potential, especially if we consider that 95.2% of the energy required by mobility is produced using non-renewable fossil fuels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In their recent study, Froemelt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> found that both transport and housing are responsible for 25% of the Swiss carbon footprint each, and thus make for the most important consumption categories. Similarly, Taptich et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found that 23% of the world's anthropogenic GHGs stem from passenger and freight vehicles.</p><p>While improving the efficiency of existing power generation technologies or gradually replacing them with more sustainable alternatives reduces GHG emissions, changes in mobility behavior of people may also help in reaching the desired sustainability goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Several studies treat automatic movement and mobility tracking, and the effects of various stimuli on mobility behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Another line of research analyzes the possible impacts of various future mobility technologies. One example is the replacement of internal combustion engines with electrical motors, usually also taking into account the fuel production/ electricity generation using renewable sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Next to a rise in electric cars, we see a similar trend for electric bicycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which poses the question of what the potential impacts on energy consumption of a wide-spread deployment of e-bikes would be. E-bikes greatly enhance the applicability of traditional bicycles, as they allow people to travel faster, with less effort, and for greater distances. At the same time, they require much less energy than an electric car, as they are more light-weight, exhibit slower speeds, and allow the driver to add additional (human) energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>However, people usually prefer cars when they have to cover long distances, are traveling with luggage, or if the weather conditions are bad <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For example, in a study representative of the Swiss population, 60% of all e-bike users noted that they use the bicycle less during bad weather, and 14% said they are not using it at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. A similar effect can be seen during cold weather: 28% of the study participants do not use the e-bike in winter, while 54% use it less <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In addition, having to recharge batteries and the related range anxiety (though not as strong as with electric cars) might hinder the adoption of electric bicycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we look at the potential effects of various e-bike adoption scenarios in Switzerland. Based on statistical data about the mobility behavior of people, we consider different influencing variables, such as temperature, precipitation, or travel distance, and model the commuter energy demand. This allows us to assess the potential for GHG emission reductions by e-bike deployment, and to quantify how many people (and in which environmental conditions) would have to switch to e-bikes in order to have a substantial impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work</head><p>The energy demand of different mobility strategies and solutions has been modeled and studied extensively.

It is less common to study the overall effects of a wide bicycle deployment, but much has been done in terms of evaluating bicycle route choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, the influence of the built environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, or the influence of weather and environment on the use of bicycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</p><p>Looking at the energy consumptions of e-bikes, a variety of models (often adapted from electric car models) treat the influence of elevation, speed, and human power on the energy demand on a given route <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. In combination with an extensive life cycle assessment (LCA), this allows to capture the overall energy requirements resp. GHG emissions per kilometer traveled by e-bike. An LCA provides numbers on the energy requirements and GHG emissions over the whole life cycle of a vehicle, including resource acquisition, vehicle production, its use for transport and its disposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The Mobitool report provides LCA-based numbers for a range of transport options in Switzerland <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>If everyone travels using electric cars or bicycles, it still needs to be analyzed where the energy to charge them comes from. Renewable energy sources provide the most attractive option in terms of sustainability, but it has yet to be determined which modes of transport they can easily power, how much installed power generation is required, and where to optimally place them. Various studies look at the possibility of using renewable energy to directly charge batteries of electric vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. This is particularly interesting, as these vehicles often stand unused, and can help absorbing peaks in energy production, which are quite common for photovoltaics and wind turbines <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</p><p>On a day to day base, the weather influences the choice whether to travel by bicycle quite heavily <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Even if someone is generally considering the bike for commuting, his or her choice is also determined by other factors, such as the requirements to carry luggage, the distance of the commute, and the general attitude towards bicycling and environmental aspects of mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Several researchers studied if it is possible to convince people to change their mobility behavior towards more sustainable means of transport, often heavily supported by automated tracking technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>. Their findings include a very high interest for such systems, and a positive attitude towards reducing energy.</p><p>Only a few studies looked at the energy aspect of electric bicycles. Pierce et al. analyzed the energy and carbon savings when using electric bicycles instead of cars for General Practitioner of the National Health Service in the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. In a study by Mathez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, the GHG savings of the employees of the McGill university in Montreal were estimated using an online survey.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data</head><p>The occupancy rate of cars in Great Britain kept decreasing over the last 30 years from 1.82 in 1970 to 1.58 in 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Switzerland shows similar trends, with a decrease from 1.63 in 1994 to 1.56 in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Only considering commutes to work, the occupancy rate becomes as low as 1.10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, and in most cases commuters do not have to carry more baggage than what is possible to transport on a bicycle. In addition, the average distance traveled for a single commuting journey is 12.4 km in Switzerland <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, a distance that is commonly covered by people commuting by e-bike: 58% of all e-bike commuters in Switzerland travel distances between 5 and 20 km <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Considering that commuting amounts for a substantial share of 24.0% of all traveled distances, this study thus focuses on commuter mobility, which is also recorded on a very detailed level in Switzerland, and allows making an accurate analysis of potential energy savings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Mobility data</head><p>The commuter matrix <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_1</ref> contains the number of people who travel from one municipality to another for work each day in Switzerland. The census bureau collects household statistics (i.e., the place where someone lives and the name of the company someone works at) from the social security register, which is combined with the corporation register (containing the address of the company). Together, these registers allow building a very detailed commuter mobility dataset, which is available at a municipality level.</p><p>We combine the commuter data with values from Mobitool <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, a Swiss platform for mobility management tools and specifically edited environmental data <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_2</ref>. Mobitool contains emission and energy consumption factors for the most common transport modes during various life cycle stages, e.g., the energy demand caused by the production and disposal of the vehicle, or the CO 2 emissions released during the construction and maintenance of roads or rails. While this life cycle view is important to compute the overall energy savings from a shift towards electric mobility, it is usually of little concern for the driver of an electric bike, who primarily is interested in how far one can drive with a certain (remaining) charge.</p><p>As it is unclear from the commuter matrix alone which people use a certain mode of transport, we additionally consider the official public transportation accessibility classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. This Switzerland-wide categorization assigns every location a class in A-E, where A usually means a public transport stop is available in close vicinity, and E denotes that a place is far away from any public transportation. In combination with data from the mobility census (which tells us the distribution of transport modes that people use within each public transportation accessibility class) and the spatial distribution of the population, these classes allow computing the number of people in a municipality that use a certain mode of transport to get to another municipality. In the resulting dataset, we primarily look at people traveling by car, and evaluate the energy demand considering different circumstances under which these people would travel by e-bike instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Weather data</head><p>According to Buffat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, 74% of people use the e-bike less or much less on rainy days, and 82% report the same for cold periods during winter. To model this dependency on weather, we use the COSMOS-REA6 meteorological dataset from the Hans-Ertel-Center for Weather Research<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_3</ref> for temperature and precipitation. This dataset was created using reanalysis and the COSMO weather model (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>). It is available in an hourly resolution for the period 1995-2015 and has a mesh resolution of ∘ 0.055 . At the latitude of Switzerland (approx. 47.5°n orth), this corresponds to cells roughly 6.2 km by 4.2 km.</p><p>Often, people are not uniformly distributed within these weather cells. Especially for the temperature and in mountainous regions (due to large temperature differences across small distances), this means that the value reported in the COSMO dataset might differ from the actual temperature in a village where people live. In combination with the spatial distribution of people (the same dataset that was used to compute the share of car commuters) we use the digital elevation model (DEM) swissALTI3D, as provided by Swisstopo <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_4</ref> , to compute a temperature correction coefficient that adjusts the value reported by COSMO for each municipality.</p><p>Finally, it is important to put the energy demand of various e-bike adaption scenarios in relation to the total current energy demand and production, both given current power plants and fossil fuels, as well as considering the potential of future renewable energy sources. In this respect, it is particularly interesting to see how much of the required energy could be supplied using photovoltaic, wind and hydro power. We use the data and results from several studies assessing the energy production potential from renewable sources to put the energy savings computed in this paper into perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Method and analysis</head><p>This section describes the different steps of our model to quantify the energy demand and GHG emissions of the different scenarios. We first estimate the length, duration, energy demand and GHG emissions of each route (by car and by bicycle) between two municipalities appearing in the commuter matrix. Using this information, as well as the number of people traveling the respective route and a set of weather scenarios, we compute the aggregated energy demands and GHG emissions for each municipality. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows all the steps involved in our method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Computing the commuter mobility energy demand</head><p>The commuter matrix of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office contains how many people travel from one municipality to another for work on each day. To get an accurate estimate of the route traveled on the road network we compute the population centroid for each municipality using the method presented in Buffat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. In essence, the method samples the population within each municipality on a 100 × 100 m grid. The population value assigned to each cell corresponds to the number of people living within a 500 m radius from the center of the cell. Out of all these cells, the one where most people live is then taken as the centroid of the respective municipality. This approach was required for mountainous regions, where weighted centroids are often far from the road network, and thus make routing inaccurate if not impossible. For the case where people live and work in the same municipality we estimate the travel distance based on Buffat et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> with a detour factor of 1.46 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_5</ref> . This method is based on computing the distance from each grid cell to the selected municipality centroid, weighting it by the number of people living within that cell, and multiplying it by the above detour factor.</p><p>The shortest (or most suitable) routes between two municipalities often differ for various modes of transport, such as bicycles or cars. For example, riding a bicycle on a highway is usually not permitted while cars are not allowed in pedestrian areas. For this reason, we compute two different routes between every two municipalities appearing in the commuter matrix: one route for traveling by car and one for traveling by bicycle. The routes are computed using the Open Source Routing Machine <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_6</ref> (OSRM), which operates on OpenStreetMap data, and allows selecting different transport mode profiles (in our case, the default car and bicycle). Note that at this point in our method, we do not make a distinction between electric and conventional bicycles, as we argue that the chosen routes would not differ enough to have a large impact on this study. A future extension could create a separate routing profile for e-bikes in OSRM.</p><p>The most important characteristics for our purpose are the route length l H W mode ,(where H stands for the municipality somebody lives in (home), W for the municipality somebody works at and mode stands for the mode of transport), denoted as l H W car . The duration of the route is determined by OSRM in the case of cars, while for e-bikes we assume an average speed of -25 km h 1 . This arguably optimistic value was chosen because users of e-bikes that still offer assistance at speeds above -25 km h 1 are required to have a drivers licence and insurance in Switzerland <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and because e-bike riders state that they like electric bicycles as they allow them to quickly reach a destination without much physical exertion (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>).</p><p>Given the travel distance l H, W, mode and the conversion factors (e mode ) from Mobitool (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), we can compute the total energy demand e H, W, mode considering different parts (direct use, energy provision, etc.) as shown in Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">eH , W , mode = lH , W , mode⋅emode<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In addition to the actual travel distances, it is important to assess how many people actually use the car for this trip (we disregard other modes, as we are only interested in the energy saving potential from people switching from car to electric bicycle). Thus, we have to estimate the percentage of car drivers for each municipality.</p><p>The public transport accessibility classification dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> assigns a unique class (A-E), based on public transport accessibility, to each location within Switzerland. For each class, the mobility census <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> reports the percentage of people traveling by foot, bicycle, motorized individual transport (car), public transport and "other". In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, we summarized the important values of people traveling by car in each class.</p><p>To derive the percentage of car commuters car M for each munici- pality (M), we weigh the percentages shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> with the number of people living in each public transport quality class (ptc) using Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∑ = ⋅ = car Inhabitants Inhabitants p M ptc A E ptc all ptc<label>(2)</label></formula><p>The number of people living in each public transport quality class are computed by combining the GEOSTAT population dataset <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_7</ref> , which contains the number of people living within cells with a resolution of 100×100 m with the above mentioned public transport quality class dataset. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows the percentage of car commuters for each municipality. When compared to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, it can be seen that the urban areas with a high population density and dense public transportation networks have a lower percentage of car commuters compared to the agglomeration and the rural municipalities.</p><p>Using the number of people commuting on each route (P H, W) we can compute the total energy demand of each route and mode using Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>). We thereby assign the energy of a route to its "home" municipality. To estimate the round-trip energy demand we multiply with a factor of 2.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">EH , W , mode = 2⋅carH ⋅PH , W ⋅eH , W , mode<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In Equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">3</ref>), different values for modes can be chosen, depending on the likelihood of choice for a single mode of transport. Considering the mode EV, for example, E H W EV ,would stand for the energy demand if everybody that is currently commuting by car would use an electric vehicle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Building combined transport and weather scenarios</head><p>It is known that the number of daily bicycle commutes depends on weather factors such as temperature and precipitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Ultimately, we are interested in the number of days someone would likely be willing to travel by bike, i.e., the temperature should not be too low, and optimally there would be little or no rain at all.</p><p>For each municipality, we derive monthly weather statistics using the COSMO REA6 dataset (see section 3.2). We calculate the percentages of days (w T, R, m) of each month m where the minimal temperature is above or equal temperature T and the amount of precipitation during commutes is not larger than R. More precisely, we count the number of days the minimal temperature during the commute (assumed to be at 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.) is equal or above a treshold T and the total daily precipitation is below a threshold R. Dividing the counted number of days by the of days in the observation period (1995-2015) gives a long term estimate on the percentage of days that are suitable for taking a bicycle, assuming one is willing to take the bicycle when the weather is better than the set values for T and R. We then use the centroids of the municipalities to identify the corresponding grid cells of the COSMO-RA6 dataset. As the temperature is highly sensitive to elevation (but in general approximately linearly dependent), we use a correction factor of 0.66°C for every 100 m of elevation difference between the municipality elevation and the elevation used in the COSMO-RA6 model (which corresponds to the elevation at the center of the respective grid cell). We validated the correction using publicly available data from the 160 weather measurement stations in Switzerland <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_8</ref> . While several studies report on the weather-and distance-averseness of cyclists <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, there seem to be no conclusive numbers (especially taking into consideration the more recent wide distribution of electrical bicycles) which would allow us to clearly identify a single optimal future scenario.</p><p>We thus report our findings along three axes of interest: the maximal duration d for which somebody is willing to use an e-bike, the minimal temperature T at which somebody is still willing to use an e-bike as well as the maximal precipitation R. This means that interested researchers can look at the energy savings at suitable points of interest for them. E.g., someone might assume that people travel by bicycle for a maximum of 30 min (for their commutes), at any given temperature, but only if the daily precipitation stays below 5 mm.</p><p>We computed the total energy demand for all of the following values: d  ∈ {15,30,45,60} min, T ∈ {−10, −9, …, 29,30} °C, and ∈ … R {0,1, , 29,30} mm. The resulting energy demand and GHG emissions matrix (where all values are in GWh) is supplied as additional material with this paper, and can be downloaded via the research collection of ETH Zurich <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">foot_9</ref>. The energy demand for each municipality (EM , mode (R, T , d ) ) for a scenario depends on different values for R, T and a maximum e-bike duration d and is calculated using Equation (<ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">4</ref>). Thereby it is assumed that routes with e-bike durations (d M W ( , ) ebike ) longer than d are exclusively traveled by car. W denotes the set of all work municipalities the municipality has a route to. Shorter routes are traveled either by e-bike or car depending on the monthly weather coefficient (w R T m , , ) for the chosen scenario. The energy demand of each route is then multiplied with the number of workdays wd m of month m in order to obtain estimates of the monthly energy demand.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ = ∑ ⋅ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ∑ + ∑ ⋅ - + ⋅ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ = &gt; ≤ E R T d w d E E w E w , , (( 1 ) M mode m m W M W mode d MW d W M W mode R T m M W ebike R T m d MW d , 1 12 , , ( , ) , , , , , , , ,( , ) ebike ebike            <label>(4)</label></formula><p>The GHG emissions for each municipality are calculated in a similar way as the energy demand using the factors reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results and discussion</head><p>In this section, we pick some particularly interesting scenarios for further dissection. These scenarios should help to quantify possible future energy savings stemming from transitions to electric bicycles. We both consider the status quo, in which cars with combustion engines are prevalent, as well as a hypothetical future scenario where most people commute by electric cars.</p><p>First, let us look at the influence of people's preferences to drive by e-bike in different weather conditions. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the total energy demand from commutes by car over a whole year. On the x axis, we show the minimally acceptable temperature at which people are still taking the bicycle. The y axis shows the yearly total amount of required energy. In the top left subfigure, we additionally assume that people are maximally willing to travel 15 min by bike for their commute. This value increases in 15 min steps until the figure on the bottom right, where the maximal travel duration is 1 h.</p><p>We first consider three baseline scenarios shown by solid lines: all people commute to work only by internal combustion engine (ICE) car (orange), electrical vehicle (EV; red) or e-bike (black). In these scenarios no weather effects are considered, thus they are constant.</p><p>Scenarios where people start to deviate from car commuting by taking the electric bicycle are shown as dashed (no precipitation allowed, i.e., people stop using the bicycle as soon as there is any amount of rain on a given day) and dotted lines (people use the bicycle on a given day regardless of precipitation). These curves change depending on the temperature, as this influences the probability with which an e-bike is chosen over the car. An x value of -5°C, for example, means that people would take the e-bike on every day where the minimum temperature at 8 a.m. in the morning or 5 p.m. in the evening is above -5°C for routes with a duration smaller than the indicated maximum duration. As temperatures in most parts of Switzerland seldom go below -10°C or above 25°C (on average), the curves start to flatten out as they reach the lower bound limited by the maximal duration parameter.</p><p>Similarly, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the same scenarios, but considers the reductions in GHG emissions instead of savings in the cumulative energy demand. In this case, as electric power in Switzerland is mostly produced by hydro and nuclear power (over 90%), large savings can come from a transition to electric cars, and the additional effects of e-bikes are less prominent. As the figures show, the maximal energy demand reductions are in the order of 7.1 TWh (corresponding to 43.8% of the total energy demand of all commutes registered in the commuter matrix) without an additional deployment of electric vehicles, and in the order of 9.7 TWh (59.9%) including a replacement of ICE cars with electric ones. Similarly, the GHG emission reductions range from 1.6 Mt (44.8%; without electric cars) to 2.6 Mt (75.2%; including electric cars).</p><p>Compared to the total energy demand of Switzerland, 232 TW h (in 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>), the savings might look smallhowever, if we only consider energy from diesel and gasoline (primarily used for land-based transport, in contrast to kerosene, coal, natural gas, etc.), totaling to 61 TW h, we get a reduction of up to 11.6% without any electric cars, and up to 15.9% including electric cars. Note that these numbers only consider energy requirements of commuting, whereas e-cars and ebikes would likely also be used for other forms of travel if they are available. In terms of GHG emissions, similar reductions are possible: Considering the total CO 2 emissions by traffic of 15.0 Mt in 2016 <ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">foot_10</ref> , replacing car commuter journeys yields a reduction of 10.4% when solely considering electric bicycles, and 17.5% when additionally considering a shift from ICE cars to electric ones. These upper reduction bounds take into account that people would be willing to drive up to 60 min, no matter the temperature or precipitation levels.</p><p>As the choice to travel by bicycle is heavily depending on weather (next to personal context, such as need to carry luggage, safety-and comfort-related preferences, etc.), it is important to look at the seasonal influence on energy savings. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> depicts the monthly saving potentials for energy and GHG emissions over the course of a year. Here, we assumed people would be willing to travel 30 min by e-bike for each commute, as this corresponds to the mean commuting distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>The seasonal influence is easily visible: In winter months, for all scenarios (starting from one where people would still travel by bike if the temperature is above 0°C), the energy savings are significantly less than during summer months. But even in summer months, to make electric bicycles contribute significantly to an energy reduction, people should show willingness to travel by bike at least on days where the minimal acceptable temperature is 10°C or more.</p><p>Not only temperature but also rain has an effect on the likeliness to commute by bike. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows the influence of minimal temperature and maximal amount of tolerable rain. Especially for temperatures below 15°C the effect of precipitation is visible.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> shows the possible energy saving potential per inhabitant on a municipality level. Several "rings" around big cities with a high population density are visible. Thus, suburban areas in close vicinity to a larger city are particularly interesting targets for sustainability incentives (such as subsidizing electric bicycles or expanding bicycle networks by building fast lanes directly into the cities), as the potential savings per inhabitant are the largest. The reason for this phenomena is that while in the cities the total potential energy savings are much larger due to a higher number of inhabitants, many people there do not have to travel far or are using public transport or another form of sustainable transport (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>Previous work looked at e-bike travel behavior, bike sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, ebike safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, adaption rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> or energy consumption of electric bicycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This study investigates the energy and GHG emission savings potential of e-bikes when used for commuting. Our model considers different factors, such as temperature, precipitation and maximal travel duration.</p><p>Naturally, the energy savings are largest if people are willing to travel longer distances by bicycle. When assuming that e-bikes are used for commutes up to a duration of 1 h, energy demand reductions up to approx. 45% are achievable (on the same routes, i.e., not taking the total mobility into account, but only the share of car commutes), in case that people would choose the bicycle independently of the weather. To help putting this into perspective, consider that we assumed that people traveling by bicycle are moving approximately with half the speed in comparison to people traveling by car for short to medium distance routes. This means that the durations approximately double when transitioning from car to bicycle. Usually, this is less of an issue for shorter trips (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>), e.g., for trips of 15 or 30 min (where the duration would have been 7.5 and 15 min by car). The average commute duration in Switzerland in 2016 was 30.3min <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, which would still allow for energy demand reductions of up to approx. 22% without taking into account possible shifts to electric cars.</p><p>For an alpine country such as Switzerland, the weather conditions realistically prevent large shares of the population from using an e-bike throughout the whole year. Literature shows us approximatively how temperature and precipitation influence the frequency of bicycle trips <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. To reflect this, we modeled different scenarios which allow us to compare the influence of the reaction of people to temperature and precipitation. For example, assuming that all current car commutes that could be traveled within up to 30 min on an e-bike are replaced by this choice, on days where the temperature during the commute is at least 10°C and there is no precipitation, an energy demand resp. GHG reduction of approx. 8% is achievable. While the effect of precipitation is less prominent (in the sense that it only rains little on most rainy days, i.e., between 1 and 2 mm per day, and thus the rain aversion could practically be modeled as a binary variable), the effect of temperature is clearly visible. Especially when looking at the energy consumption throughout the year, we can see that people should be willing to travel even at temperatures of around 10°C in order to have an impact on the GHG emissions.</p><p>If we consider that many people need to be actively convinced to use e-bikes before the above scenarios become reality, it is also interesting to look at where to put marketing and persuasive efforts. Several projects analyze the use of soft incentives to persuade people to change their behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, while other approaches focus on economic or infrastructural changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>. Knowing where to deploy such incentives for maximal effect is particularly important for companies and organizations operating in the environmental space, but will also concern policy makers and last but not least electric bicycle sellers. In this study we identified suburbs as the regions with the highest saving potentials, as many people commute to the close-by city centers, yet are not as far away as to make e-bike rides completely unfeasible. Thus, a conclusion from our work is that governments should improve and expand the cycling infrastructure on routes from suburbs to city centers in order to facilitate the here presented energy savings. Similarly, environmentally aligned companies and organizations should focus on these areas to convince people to try out e-bikes and nudge them to make a transition to more environmentally friendly behavior.</p><p>To determine the potential future adoption of electric bicycles, it is important to note that the initial investment costs of an e-bike are much lower compared to electric vehicles. For example, no charging infrastructure needs to be deployed, as battery chargers for e-bikes are typically small and can easily be installed in homes or offices. Similarly, the cost of buying an electric bicycle is much lower than for an electric car. Several researchers studied additional benefits such as positive health effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>, more economical transport (as compared to cars) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, an increase in available space within cities and on roads and a reduction of congestion in cities (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>). However, several factors are known that limit the adoption of cycling, such as safety issues due to inadequate cycling infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, mountainous regions or the previously described effects of weather and climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Future work should consider these variables for a more complete assessment of the potential of electric bicycles, model the effects of integrated mobility (where for example the e-bike is used to ride to a train station close by), widen the here presented research to commuters using public transport and apply the model to leisure mobility. While Switzerland might not be representative for a majority of countries in terms of mobility, our restriction on car commuters allows some generalization across borders. It has shown that the potential of electric bicycles is non-negligible, but could benefit from nudging people in particular suburban regions to switch to e-bikes, and provide incentives for them to commute even at lower temperatures.</p></div>
