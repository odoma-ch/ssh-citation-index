<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether empathizing and systemizing are part of the parental broad autism phenotype (BAP). Parents (N = 76) of preschool children with a diagnosis of ASD and parents (N = 48) of typically developing (TD) children completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R) questionnaires. The E-S discrepancy (D score) was used to test for sex differences in five "brain types". Our results suggest that the E-S theory do not seem to be part of the BAP. However, a stronger drive to systemize than empathize (Type S brain) could be a highly inheritable cognitive endophenotype of mothers of children with ASD.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition marked by deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(American Psychiatric Association 2013)</ref>. The exact cause of ASD is still undetermined. Strong scientific evidence points to genetic predisposition, environmental or unknown factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chaste and Leboyer 2012)</ref>. Although research confirms that defined mutations, genetic syndromes and de novo Copy number variation (CNV) account for about 10-20% of ASD cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jeste and Geschwind 2014)</ref>, recent twin studies provide estimates for ASD heritability between 64 and 91% <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Tick et al. 2016)</ref>, indicating a strong interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rossignol et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Genetic, neurofunctional and clinical data show that traits similar to, yet not as severe as those of ASD, are also heritable <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Billeci et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Freitag 2007)</ref>. These subclinical features, seen in first-degree relatives of individuals with ASD, have been described as broad autism phenotype (BAP). This term describes an even wider range of individuals with cognitive styles, personality traits, and social-behavioral characteristics that are similar to, yet milder, than those observed in ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Losh et al. 2008)</ref>. Following the development of advanced quantitative tools, such as the Autism Quotient (AQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baron-Cohen et al. 2001)</ref> or the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hurley et al. 2007)</ref>, several studies have found that BAP traits are frequent in parents and siblings of individuals with ASD, supporting the hypothesis of a significant genetic heritability for ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pisula and Ziegart-Sadowska 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rubenstein et al. 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Among the different cognitive theories explaining ASD, Baron-Cohen's Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) theory proposes that the core features of ASD can be explained by a deficit in empathizing alongside intact or superior systemizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron-Cohen 2009,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">2010)</ref>. Empathizing is defined as "the drive to identify another person's emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with appropriate emotion" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron-Cohen 2009)</ref>. It also involves being able to predict people's behavior. Systemizing is defined as "the drive to analyze or construct systems (e.g. collectable systems, mechanical systems, numerical systems)" that follow rules in order to predict how that system will behave <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baron-Cohen 2006)</ref>. In order to quantify these dimensions, self-report questionnaires such as the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Systemizing Quotient-revised (SQ-R) were developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baron-Cohen et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright 2004)</ref>. The E-S theory suggests that a deficit in empathizing might account for the social and communication abnormalities diagnosed in autism, and it could even account for difficulties in Theory of Mind (ToM), namely the ability to understand others' mental states. However, a deficit in empathizing has little if anything to contribute to the non-social features of autism. On the other hand, intact or superior systematizing abilities might account for repetitive behavior, narrow interests, islets of ability and resistance to change/need for sameness.</p><p>The E-S theory was later re-worked into the 'Extreme Male Brain' (EMB) theory of autism <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baron-Cohen 2002)</ref>, whereby ASD reflects an extreme of the typical male profile. The male brain is defined psychometrically as those individuals in whom systemizing is significantly better than empathizing, and the female brain is defined as the opposite cognitive profile. Baron-Cohen defines the male and female "brain types" respectively in terms of systemizing and of empathizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baron-Cohen 2002)</ref>, and, the extreme male and female brain types should be understood as poles at either end of a continuum, within which he roughly delineates five "brain types": Type S (S &gt; E), Type E (E &gt; S), Type B (balanced brain), and the Extreme Type S (S ≫ E) and E (E ≫ S) brains. According to the EMB theory, previous studies reported that adult females tend to score higher on empathizing-as measured by the EQ-while adult males score higher on systemizing-as measured by the SQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wright and Skagerberg 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright 2004)</ref>. In a large population study (on more than 670,000 individuals, including 36,648 individuals with ASD), <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Greenberg et al. (2018)</ref> revealed that typical females were on average more likely to be Type E (EQ &gt; SQ) or Extreme Type E and that typical males were on average more likely to be Type S (SQ &gt; EQ) or Extreme Type S, and individuals with ASD, regardless of their reported sex, were on average "masculinized" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Greenberg et al. 2018)</ref>. The authors suggest that this sex difference may partly reflect developmental differences in brain structure and function, which are themselves under the influence of biological and cultural factors. Both empathy and systemizing scores are partly explained by exposure levels to fetal testosterone and genetic common variance, but this in no way denies the importance of social experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Greenberg et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Considering this evidence, the E-S theory (as a twofactor theory) and the EMB theory appear to be suited to explain some features characterizing ASD. However, little research was made on the BAP in parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grove et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hasegawa et al. 2015)</ref> of children with ASD using these theories as framework. Thus, this study was specifically geared to evaluate whether empathizing and systemizing are part of the BAP. The first aim was to evaluate empathizing and systemizing in mothers and fathers of children with ASD compared with parents of typically developing (TD) children. Based on our assumption, parents of children with ASD show a significant difference in their EQ scores (expected low scores) and SQ-R scores (expected high scores) compared with parents of TD children. Second, we examined whether parents of children with ASD show on average a shift towards a more masculinized brain along the E-S dimensions compared with parents of TD children. More specifically, we hypothesized that more mothers and fathers of children with ASD would be sorted into Type S brain (S &gt; E profile) or Extreme Type S brain (S ≫ E profile) and mothers and fathers of TD children would be sorted into Type B brain (balanced, E = S) or Type E brain (E &gt; S profile) or Extreme Type E brain (E ≫ S profile). Finally, we examined the relationship between child symptom severity and empathizing or systemizing in mothers and fathers of children with ASD. We hypothesized that parental EQ scores would correlate with deficit in social communication and social interaction of children with ASD, while parental SQ-R scores would correlate with restricted interests/repetitive behaviors of children with ASD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We consecutively recruited 76 parents (46 mothers and 30 fathers) of preschool children (N = 46; aged 2-6 years) with a diagnosis of ASD. Eligibility for the current study was based on any diagnosis of ASD made by clinical experts according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(American Psychiatric Association 2013)</ref>. The clinical diagnosis of ASD was supported by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lord et al. 2012)</ref>, including the subdomains of social affect (SA) and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB).</p><p>Exclusion criteria applicable to children with ASD included hearing, visual, or physical impairments, or specified genetic syndromes (e.g., fragile X, tuberous sclerosis, Angelman syndrome, Down syndrome, MECP2 related disorders). IQ was assessed according to the age by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wechsler 1991)</ref> or Wechsler Preschool and Primary, Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wechsler 2002)</ref>. Forty-eight parents (30 mothers and 18 fathers) of TD children (N = 34; aged 2-6 years) were randomly recruited from primary schools, based on availability of parents or subjects to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria for TD children included a history of seizure disorder, progressive neurological problems, traumatic brain injury, and diagnoses of any neurodevelopmental disorders or any other serious medical condition.</p><p>Parents of both groups were enrolled if they met the following inclusion criteria: biological parents, age 18-65 years, good knowledge of written and spoken Italian, freedom of medication and no neurological or psychiatric disorders at testing. Parental informed consent was obtained for all participants and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the "Research Ethics Committee."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment</head><p>-The EQ is a self-report measure of empathizing. It was designed to assess the ability to attribute mental states to self and others and the drive to respond with an appropriate emotion to that mental state. The EQ comprises 60 questions, broken down into two types: 40 questions tapping empathy and 20 filler items. All items are rated on 4-point Likert scale ranging from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'. Empathic responses are scored 2 or 1, and non-empathic responses are scored 0. More specifically, considering the 21 empathic statements a "definitely agree" gets 2 points, a "slightly agree" gets 1 point, and "slightly disagree" and "definitely disagree" each get 0 points. On the other hand, the 19 non-empathic statements are scored as "strongly disagree" (2 points), "slightly disagree" (1 point) and "slightly agree" and "strongly agree" (0 points each). The maximum achievable total score is 80, and the lowest is zero. People with ASD tend on average to score low on the EQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright 2004)</ref>. The internal consistency of the EQ questionnaire was evaluated in the group of ASD parents and was satisfactory with a Cronbach's α of .92. The Italian version of the questionnaire is available on the ARC Tests-Autism Research Center website (<ref type="url" target="https://www.autis">https ://www.autis</ref> mrese archc entre .com/arc_tests ).</p><p>-The SQ-Revised is a 75-item self-report questionnaire measuring systemizing skills (attention to details, recognizing patterns) in various systems. Responses are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (definitely disagree, slightly disagree, slightly agree, and definitely agree). Regarding statements that are in agreement with systemizing skills, "definitely agree" gets 2 points, "slightly agree" gets 1 point, "slightly disagree" and "definitely disagree" each get 0 points. Scoring is reversed for statements describing the opposite. Minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 150, the last score referring to very high systemizing ability. People with ASD tend to score higher on the SQ than controls, and men tend to score higher on the SQ than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Baron-Cohen et al. 2003)</ref>. The Italian versions of the self-report measure is available on the ARC Tests-Autism Research Center website (<ref type="url" target="https://www">https ://www</ref>. autis mrese archc entre .com/arc_tests ).</p><p>-E-S discrepancy (D) and "brain types". The EMB theory divides people into five groups: Type E (whose empathy is at a significantly higher level than their systemizing; E &gt; S); Type S (whose systemizing is at a significantly higher level than their empathy, S &gt; E);Type B (whose empathy is at the same level as their systemizing; E = S); Extreme Type E (whose empathy is above average but whose systemizing is below average; E ≫ S); Extreme Type S (whose systemizing is above average but whose empathy is below average; S ≫ E). To calculate the difference (D) between the standardized SQ-R score and the standardized EQ score, we used the procedure described by Kidron et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kidron et al. 2018)</ref>. Raw SQ-R and EQ scores were standardized by subtracting the population mean from the score, then dividing it by the maximum possible score: S = (SQ-R-&lt; SQR &gt;)/150 and E = (EQ-&lt; EQ &gt;)/80, where &lt; SQ-R &gt; and &lt; EQ &gt; were the estimated population means (SQ-R = 55,6; EQ = 44,3) derived from a previous large-scale study (n = 1761) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goldenfeld et al. 2005)</ref>. The discrepancy between systemizing and empathizing was then quantified as D = (S -E)/2. The D scores were divided into 5 percentiles in order to calculate cognitive profiles or "brain types": individuals scoring in the lowest 2.5 percentile are defined as Extreme Type E (E ≫ S), those who score between the 2.5° and 35° percentiles are classed as Type E (E &gt; S), between the 35° and 65° percentile as Type B (balanced, E = S), between the 65° and 97.5° percentile as Type S (S &gt; E), and those scoring in highest 2.5 percentiles are Extreme Type S (S ≫ E).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analyses</head><p>All socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of children and parents were entered into the statistical analysis. Data were tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. The tests revealed that EQ and SQ-R scores were not normally distributed. Thus, nonparametric analyses were used in this study to compare the two groups. Differences among categorical variables were evaluated by the Chi squared (χ 2 ) test (gender, parent's educational level, parent's job and distribution of D scores across the five "brain types"). The χ 2 enabled us to assess whether the observed cell counts are significantly different from the expected cell counts. Statistical significance in this case is due to difference between observed and expected frequencies. Differences among continuous variables (age of children, age of mothers and father, IQ, EQ, SQ-R, and D scores) between groups (ASD vs. TD; Boys and Girls with ASD) were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test. The non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was performed to evaluate differences in continuous variables between mothers and fathers of each group. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used in analysis of correlations between empathizing and systemizing in mothers and fathers of each group. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis was used to determine the relations between child symptom severity (ADOS-2 scores) and empathizing or systemizing (EQ, SQ-R, and D scores) in mothers and fathers of children with ASD. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to evaluate the differences of the means of the IQ and ADOS-2 scales among the "brain types" classification within mothers and fathers of children with ASD. Additionally, for the Post-Hoc analysis Tamhane's T2 was used.</p><p>A p value of &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. For statistical processing, we used the Statistical Package for Social Science version 20.0</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of ASD and TD groups are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. No statistical differences in age (p = 0.067) and gender (p = 0.46) of children and paternal age (p = 0.13) were found between the two groups. However, we found a significant difference in the parent's educational level (p = 0.002; p = 0.008), and mother's jobs (p = 0.006) between the ASD and TD groups. Mothers of children with ASD had a lower education and mostly low-paid jobs than mothers of TD children, while fathers of children with ASD had lower high school diploma rates than fathers of TD children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empathizing and Systemizing</head><p>We first investigated sex differences in the EQ and SQ-R measures. Mean scores and standard deviations on the EQ and SQ-R scores per group and sex are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. There were no significant differences on the EQ (p = 0.17) and SQ-R (p = 0.94) scores between mothers of children with ASD and mothers of TD children. Similarly, no significant differences on the EQ (p = 0.99) and SQ-R (p = 0.054) between fathers of children with ASD and fathers of TD children were found. By contrast, an evaluation of the differences in EQ and SQ-R among mothers and fathers within each group revealed statistically significant differences across all three measures (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) in the TD group. In this group, fathers had higher SQ-R (p &lt; 0.001) scores than mothers, while mothers had higher EQ (p = 0.042) scores than fathers. Surprisingly, we did not find significant differences in EQ (p = 0.059) and SQ-R (p = 0.312) scores between mothers and fathers of the ASD group.</p><p>A correlation analysis was performed for mothers and fathers enrolled in the study, but we found no significant (r = -0.15, p = 0.18; r = 0.17, p = 0.15; respectively) correlation between SQ-R and EQ scores. When looking at the ASD and TD groups separately (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we found a non-significant negative correlation between SQ-R and EQ scores in mothers (r = -0.16, p = 0.26) of children with ASD. A nonsignificant positive correlation between SQ-R and EQ scores was observed in mothers of TD children (r = 0.15, p = 0.42) and in fathers of children with ASD (r = 0.12, p = 0.44) or TD (r = 0.16, p = 0.36).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"Brain Types"</head><p>We next investigated differences in D scores and "brain types" between and within groups. There were no significant differences in D scores of mothers (p = 0.91) and fathers (p = 0.61) between groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). A comparison within groups showed that fathers of children with ASD (p &lt; 0.001) or TD (p &lt; 0.001) had higher D scores than mothers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the percent of participants from both groups according to "brain type", while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the observed and expected frequencies of mothers and fathers from both groups with each "brain type". Comparing mothers of the two groups, we identified a statistically significant difference (p = 0.037) in the prevalence of "brain type". We observed that a larger proportion of mothers in the ASD group was classified as Type S brain, while a larger proportion of mothers in the TD group was classified as Type B brain or Type E brain. In both groups, fathers did not have an Extreme Type E or Extreme Type S brain. There was no significant difference in "brain types" classification across fathers in both groups (p = 0.16).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship and Correlation Analysis Between Child Symptom Severity and Parental BAP</head><p>We also analyzed the relationship between child symptom severity and empathizing or systemizing in mothers and fathers of children with ASD. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a, b</ref> shows differences in IQ and ADOS-2 (SA and RRB) scores among "brain type" of mothers and fathers of children with ASD. Children of mothers classified as Type S brain had higher RBB scores than those of mothers classified as Type B (p = 0.042) or Type E (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in IQ and ADOS-2 (SA and RRB) scores across "brain types" classification of fathers.</p><p>In the mothers of children with ASD (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), we found that ADOS-2-RRB scores correlated negatively with EQ scores (r = -0.34, p = 0.01) and correlated positively with D scores (r = 0.39, p = 0.002). We no found significant correlations between ADOS-2 (SA and RRB), EQ, SQ-R, and D scores in the fathers of children with ASD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship Between the Gender of Children and Parental BAP</head><p>Furthermore, we examined the differences between the gender of children with ASD and the EQ, SQ-R and D scores of mothers and fathers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). We found a significant difference in D scores of mothers of girls with ASD compared with mothers of boys with ASD (p = 0.025). There was no significant differences in EQ and SQ-R scores between mothers of boys and girls with ASD. Similarly, we no found significant differences in EQ, SQ-R and D scores between fathers of boys and girls with ASD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether E-S and EMB theories are part of the BAP in parents of children with ASD. This study is the first to compare empathizing (measured by the EQ questionnaire) and systemizing (measured by the SQ-R questionnaire) between mothers and fathers of children with ASD and healthy, sex-and age-matched controls. A search of the literature revealed only two recent case-control studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grove et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hasegawa et al. 2015)</ref> that compared parents of children with ASD and parents of TD children using E-S theory. Hasegawa et al. reported no significant differences in AQ, EQ and SQ-R scores between parents who have children with ASD (n = 44) and parents who have TD children (n = 30) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hasegawa et al. 2015)</ref>. Grove et al. found no significant differences in systemizing factor scores between groups. However, they found a stronger association between empathizing and systemizing in individuals with ASD and parents of children with ASD than in the control population <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grove et al. 2013)</ref>. The current study provides the opportunity to not only replicate Groves's findings, but also to establish if the EQ/SQ  relationship differs between the mothers and father of children with ASD or TD. Consistent with the literature, no difference in EQ and SQ-R was found between mothers of the ASD group and mothers of the TD group, and between fathers of the ASD group and fathers of the TD group. In contrast to Groves's findings, however, no evidence of significant correlation between empathizing and systemizing in mothers and fathers of children with ASD or TD were detected. This result reflect those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Greenberg et al. (2018)</ref> who also found a small but nonsignificant inverse correlation between EQ and SQ, suggesting EQ and SQ are largely dissociable dimensions.</p><p>In the current study, we found no evidence to support the E-S theory as part of the BAP since no significant group differences were found on each of these measures. Although the E-S theory is a cognitive explanation of the core features of ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baron-Cohen 2009)</ref>, this does not apply to the parent group as parents do not have a diagnosis of ASD themselves and are therefore not directly selected to score high on systemizing and low on empathizing.</p><p>Nevertheless, the hypothesized main sex differences empathizing and systemizing were replicated. In the TD group, we confirmed that mothers scored higher on EQ than fathers, while fathers scored higher on SQ-R and D scores than mothers. Results showed that scoring patterns among mothers and fathers were consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kidron et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wright and Skagerberg 2012)</ref>, where typical females obtained higher EQ scores than typical males, and typical males obtained higher SQ-R and D scores than typical females. This implies a greater tendency for mothers of TD children, as compared to fathers, to identify with other's emotions and thoughts, and respond with an appropriate emotion. On the other hand, fathers of TD children demonstrated a greater tendency to analyze, understand, predict, control, and construct rule-based systems.</p><p>Surprisingly, no differences were found in EQ and SQ-R between mothers and fathers of children with ASD. This finding was unexpected and it could be associated with the distribution of D scores across the five "brain types". In the TD group, clear sex effects on the five "brain types" emerged, supporting the EMB theory-based hypothesis as in typical population <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Greenberg et al. 2018)</ref>. Indeed, a greater proportion of mothers fall into Type E and Type B and a greater proportion of fathers fall into Type S. By contrast, in the ASD group, a greater proportion of mothers tend to fall into Type S compared to mothers of TD children. This shows that a group of mothers of children with ASD, classified as Type S brain, have a stronger tendency to systemize than to empathize compared to mothers of TD children. However, as stated above, there were no significant differences in EQ and SQ-R scores between mothers of children with ASD and mothers of TD children.</p><p>Taken together, these results could suggest that the E-S theory cannot be considered part of the BAP of parents of children with ASD, but a male brain profile (S &gt; E) could be a cognitive endophenotype of mothers of children with ASD. Within this context, the BAP refers to subclinical features or symptoms seen in the relatives of individuals with ASD, while an endophenotype is a biologic marker of disease that shows clear heritability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Flint and Munafò 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gottesman and Gould 2003)</ref>. There has been great interest in evaluating whether neurobiological and neurocognitive endophenotypes also characterize the relatives of autistic probands. Indeed, should the same brain abnormalities as seen in ASD patients also affect their direct relatives, their heritable origin would be strongly supported together with their role as endophenotypes of the disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Billeci et al. 2016)</ref>. This is particularly true for studies exploring correlations in parents. While sibling and twin studies are suitable for detecting brain abnormalities under genetic control, studies on parents allow mitigating the role of the shared (pre-and perinatal) environment. Thus, if brain abnormalities are observed in parents, they are more likely to be of heritable origin and consequently reflect endophenotypes of the disorder. In the current study, the male brain profile in mothers refers to mental functions that are mediated by brain processes where systemizing is at a significantly higher level than their empathy. Thus, we can assume that a stronger drive to systemize than to empathize could be a highly inheritable cognitive endophenotype of children with ASD, in line with the fetal testosterone theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baron-Cohen et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lai et al. 2012)</ref>. According to this theory, fetal testosterone influences the development of certain structures in the brain, and these changes relate to behavioral traits seen in autism. Future studies are needed to investigate the association and correlation between levels of testosterone and "brain type" in mothers of ASD.</p><p>In addition, the brain basis of "brain types" still needs to be understood, and some studies have begun to map these. Previous studies show that an increasing S &gt; E profile was associated with increased gray matter volume (GMV) in cingulate and dorsal medial prefrontal areas which have been implicated in processes related to cognitive control, monitoring, error detection, and probabilistic inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Floris et al. 2018)</ref>. A stronger drive to systemize than to empathize (S &gt; E) was related to larger volumes of bilateral midline cingulate, paracingulate and prefrontal structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lai et al. 2012)</ref>. Recently, Takeuchi et al. investigated the regional GMV correlates of empathizing and systemizing and their sex-related differences in a large sample of typically developing young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Takeuchi et al. 2014)</ref>. They found that the GMVs in regions in the default mode network (DMN) were correlated with empathizing, while those in external attention system (EAS) regions were correlated with systemizing. These findings provide insights into the biological basis of individual differences in empathizing and systemizing and point to directions for future studies on the neuropsychological basis of dispositional cognitive styles. Despite these promising results, there are still many unanswered questions about neurobiological basis of these different brain profiles. Further studies are needed to investigate if there is any true, replicable differences in brain neurophysiology that would correspond to these five putative "brain types". Identifying network-specific sex differentiation of intrinsic brain function in mothers of children with ASD could better elucidate the hereditary mechanisms involved in the various clinical dimension of ASD.</p><p>Finally, we examined the relationship between child symptom severity and specific subtypes of the BAP in parents (i.e., the, EQ and SQ-R scores) that are specifically associated with disturbances in reciprocal social interactions and communication (ADOS-2-SA) or restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (ADOS-2-RRB) in their children with ASD. Previous studies have established that parental BAP was related to severity of symptoms in the affected child <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gerdts and Bernier 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rubenstein and Chawla 2018)</ref>. We performed a correlation study and provided the first evidence that empathizing measured by the EQ in mothers were specifically associated with restricted and repetitive behaviors, as measured by the ADOS-2-RRB score, in their children with ASD. While this finding is correlational, it might represent a shared genetic liability between mothers and offspring. Interestingly, children with ASD of mothers classified as Type S brain were characterized by higher RBB scores than those of mothers classified as Type B or Type E. This link between maternal characteristics and child autism severity is consistent with theories of multifactorial inheritance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chaste and Leboyer 2012)</ref> and suggests that a male brain profile (S &gt; E) in mothers is not just related to qualitative diagnosis of ASD in children, but also may be associated with quantitative expression of restricted interests/repetitive behaviors in children with ASD.</p><p>Interestingly, we also found that mothers of girls with ASD had higher D scores than mothers of boys with ASD, suggesting a predominant male brain profile (S &gt; E) in mothers of females children with ASD compared to males. This result was unexpected and concur with a genetic model in which inherited genetic risk is transmitted predominantly from mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zhao et al. 2007)</ref>. A recent study found that girls with ASD tend to have more large disruptions in their genomes than do boys with the disorder and inherited mutations are also more likely to be passed down from unaffected mothers than from fathers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jacquemont et al. 2014)</ref>. These authors observed an increased maternal transmission for deleterious CNVs and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in ASD cohort. Although, our sample size was too small to capture significant associations when stratified by sex, our findings could suggest that an increasing S &gt; E brain profile in mothers might be associated with an increased risk of autism in their female offspring.</p><p>This study has some limitations. The first limitation is that we did not measure the intelligence level or the socioeconomic status of parents; therefore, we could not control for these potential confounds. However, all parents had no prior or current developmental, learning, or behavioral problems, and they were at or above the reading level required to understand questionnaires. A second limitation is the small sample size, which may limit ability to generalize the results to a larger population. This is an explorative, cross-sectional study to form the basis of a larger study to resolve some of these issues. Future studies with a larger study population that can assess more confounding variables are needed to replicate our findings. Moreover, further research is required to determine whether both parent scores combined predict child symptom severity better than either parent alone does.</p><p>In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to compare empathizing (measured by the EQ questionnaire) and systemizing (measured by the SQ-R questionnaire) between mothers and fathers of children with an ASD and healthy, sex-and age-matched controls. No significant differences in EQ and SQ-R scores were found between parents of children with ASD and parents of TD children. However, the assumed main sex differences in empathizing and systemizing were replicated. In the TD group, we confirmed that mothers scored higher on EQ than fathers, while fathers scored higher on SQ-R than mothers. Surprisingly, no differences were found in EQ and SQ-R scores between mothers and fathers of children with ASD. In addition, we found that a greater proportion of mothers in the ASD group were classified as Type S brain (S &gt; E) compared to mothers of TD children. Taken together, these results suggest that the E-S theory does not seem to be part of the BAP, but an S &gt; E profile could be a cognitive endophenotype of mothers of children with ASD. Interestingly, the male brain profile (S &gt; E) in mothers may be associated with quantitative expression of restricted interests/repetitive behaviors of children with ASD, particularly in female offspring. Ideally, this study should be replicated with a larger sample size and, as future direction, it is important to investigate genetic and neurobiological markers which may be associated with Type S brain among mothers of individuals with ASD.</p></div>
