It is a major crop management issue in the context of increasing water scarcity. Dynamic crop growth models can help defining optimal strategies depending on various criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen et al., 1998)</ref>. Several methodological approaches have been used so far to tackle the question of model-based irrigation scheduling:</p><p>(1) Numerical comparison of a set of predefined irrigation scenarios (which represent relatively small discrete sets of possible solutions) using complex simulation models, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Saseendran et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Vico and Porporato, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cheviron et al., 2016)</ref> among many others.</p><p>(2) Numerical optimization of a parameterized scheduling problem (e.g. optimal 2-events scheduling with water budget) using complex simulation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Li et al., 2018)</ref></p><p>(3) Numerical optimization based on optimal control theory applied to simplified models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Ramanathan et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Most existing approaches lack analytical insight on the theoretical properties of optimal solutions.

However as showed in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Shani et al., 2004)</ref>, a deeper analysis on optimal solutions might lead to better practical guidelines providing that the model accurately represents crop response to water stress.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">THE MODEL</head><p>We consider a simplified dynamical model of crop irrigation, inspired from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Pelak et al. (2017)</ref>, where S(t) and B(t) stand respectively for the relative soil humidity (a number between 0 and 1) and the crop biomass at time t belonging to an interval [0, T ] representing the crop growth season:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Ṡ = k 1 (-ϕ(t)K S (S) -(1 -ϕ(t))K R (S) + k 2 u(t))<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">Ḃ = k 3 ϕ(t)K S (S)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with the initial condition (at the sowing date 0)</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">S(0) = 1<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">B(0) = 0<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and T being the harvesting date. The control variable u(t) = F (t)/F max ∈ [0, 1] is the ratio of the input water flow rate F (t) at time t over the maximal flow F max that the irrigation device allows.</p><p>On an agronomic point of view, (<ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) represents the variation of a vertically averaged soil moisture as influenced by three fluxes: crop transpiration, crop evaporation, and crop irrigation. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Pelak et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Shani et al. (2004)</ref>, we use here the simplified hypothesis made in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bertrand et al., 2018)</ref>: transpiration and evaporation can be partitioned using a variable ϕ(t) representing the crop radiation use efficiency and independent of water stress. Both transpiration and evaporation fluxes are regulated by soil moisture as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Pelak et al., 2017)</ref> using two functions K S and K R (see Assumption 1 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> below). Equation (<ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) determines the amount of biomass produced per time unit. It is simply related to the transpiration flux using the water use efficiency principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Steduto et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Pelak et al., 2017)</ref>. Note also that the proposed model does not consider rainfall inputs and might be better associated to greenhouse grown crops.</p><p>Assumption 1.

We introduce below the MRAP (for Most Rapid Approach Path) to S = S controls. Such kind of controls have already been considered in several optimal control problems in the plane, characterizing their optimality (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Miele (1962)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hermes and Lasalle (1969)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hartl and G. Feichtinger (1987)</ref> or related to the so-called "turnpike" property (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Rapaport and Cartigny (2004)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Trélat and Zuazua (2015)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Faulwasser et al. (2017)</ref>). Here, we use it in a different way. We do not pretend that these controls are necessarily optimal (and indeed they are not), but they respect the state constraint (5) and can locally improve the cost, providing then a comparison result given in Proposition 11 below.</p><p>We begin by some definitions.</p><p>Definition 9. For (t 0 , S 0 ) ∈ [0, T ) × (S , 1], we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">t + (t 0 , S 0 ) = T if S t0,S0,0 (t) &gt; S , t ∈ [t 0 , T ] inf{t &gt; t 0 ; S t0,S0,0 (t) = S } otherwise For any (t 0 , S 0 ) ∈ (0, T ] × (S , 1], we define t -(t 0 , S 0 ) = 0 if S t0,S0,1 (t) &gt; S , t ∈ [0, t 0 ] sup{t &lt; t 0 ; S t0,S0,1 (t) = S } otherwise</formula><p>Definition 10.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">OPTIMALITY OF ONE SHOT CONTROLS</head><p>One Shot (OS) controls represent a class of widely used irrigation strategies, typically when drip irrigation is not available. They consists in delivering water at maximum flow rate during a single irrigation period. The OS control u OS tS (•) is therefore defined as a bang-bang control, parameterized by the triggering time t S ∈ [0, T ].</p><p>Definition 13.</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">u OS t S (t) := 0 if t &lt; t S or t &gt; min(t S + Q/F max , T ))</formula><p>1 if t ∈ [t S , min(t S + Q/F max , T )) A triggering time t S is said to be admissible when the control u OS tS (•) is admissible i.e. such that the constraint (5) is satisfied.</p><p>However, Proposition 12 shows that a time t S below t or above T -Q/F max (the later being the very last time to allow all the water quantity Q to be delivered by the date T ) cannot be optimal. Moreover, some values of t S ∈ [t, T -Q/F max ] could conduct the humidity rate S above the value S , which cannot be optimal neither. Therefore, we introduce instead the Saturated One Shot (SOS) feedback control (t, S, V ) → ψ SOS t S (t, S, V ) which is a bang-singular-bang or bang-bang strategy, also parameterized by a triggering time t S ∈ [t, T -Q/F max ], defined as follows.</p><p>Definition 14.</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">ψ SOS t S (t, S, V ) :=    0 if t &lt; t S or V = Q ũS (t) if t ≥ t S , S = S and V &lt; Q 1 if t ≥ t S , S &lt; S and V &lt; Q</formula><p>where ũS (•) is given in (7) and V (t) denotes the volume of water consumed up to time t, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">V (t) = F max t 0 u(τ ) dτ</formula><p>Note that this control is necessarily admissible.</p><p>In the next section, we have performed numerical comparisons between the OS ans SOS strategies for their respective best t S (i.e. maximizing B T ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We present in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> the simulations performed with irrigation strategies OS and SOS and with inputs data given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For illustrative purposes only, we have considered dimensionless parameters (by normalizing the units) and function ϕ in the family of t US→ (t/T )α (α &gt; 0).</p><p>The optimal OS strategy was obtained for tS = 0.697 and produced a biomass B(T ) = 0.152. The corresponding humidity dynamics is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>. It can be seen that some value of S are above S US . It can be therefore concluded from the application of Proposition 12 that an OS strategy cannot be optimal. This is further illustrated by applying the SOS strategies for the same inputs data. We find that the best SOS strategy gives a final biomass B(T ) = 0.176 which is 15% higher than what gives the best OS strategy. The associated control is a bang-singular- bang (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</p><p>Under water scarcity, the OS strategy is empirically used by practitioners, even though there is no model to help deciding the best triggering time. To our knowledge, the SOS strategy and more particularly its potentially late triggering time parameter t s , is new and has not been yet tested on the field. Notice that the SOS strategy requires more knowledge or online measurements than the OS control for its real application (as the expression of the singular control (7) needs the function ϕ(•) and the values S , k 2 and K R (S )). Moreover it change gradually the input flow rate during the singular arc phase. This is why it can be considered as a more sophisticated strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have introduced a simple crop irrigation model in order to study optimal irrigation scheduling using a mathematical analysis. We have shown, using a comparison tool, that the state constraint of this model is never activated for the optimal control problem solutions. Moreover we have shown that, under water scarcity, an optimal trajectory has to reach as fast as possible the domain for which the relative humidity is below or equal to the threshold of maximal crop transpiration, and then do not leave this domain until the harvesting time. However, due to water scarcity, it has to be below the threshold at some stage. We have then compared two control strategies: the one-shot (OS), commonly used in practice and a more sophisticated one, the saturated one-shot (SOS), that could exhibit a singular arc. We have shown numerically the superiority of this last strategy. We have not been yet able to prove that no more than one "saturated shot" is optimal. We conjecture that the SOS strategy is indeed an optimal control for this model. This would be a promising result since SOS irrigation schemes are not so intuitive controls and because they can be also tested on more detailed simulation models. Moreover, other criteria such as minimizing the water consumption for a desired biomass production, or maximizing the productivity could be also of interest. This shall be the matter of a future work.</p></div>
