<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>The public sector health care in South Africa, serving more than 70% of its population, faces several pressing challenges including poorresource distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Christian &amp; Crisp, 2012)</ref>, and a workforce that is drawn to the private health sector where the work environment is seen as more conducive <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ashmore, 2013)</ref>. Importantly, employment in this sector is characterized by unsocial work hours, irregular work times, intense workloads and often exhausting interactions resulting in job dissatisfaction, occupational stress and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pillay, 2009)</ref>. The brunt of this falls on the nursing profession, the largest single group of healthcare professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rispel, 2010)</ref>. There are three main categories of nurses in South Africa: Registered Nurses who have completed a four‐year programme and practise comprehensive nursing; Enrolled Nurses who have completed a two‐year programme and practise basic nursing; and Enrolled Nursing Assistants who have completed a year‐long programme and practise elementary nursing. To be certified as critical care nurses, Registered Nurses write a national examination after completion of a year of practical training in an accredited intensive care units (ICU).</p><p>Level 1 intensive care units (ICUs)-the setting for this studyare located in tertiary hospitals with specialized equipment able to manage critical illnesses. Twenty-four-hour care is managed by the ICU team and is dependent on a balance of effective organisational processes and practices, clinical resources and suitably trained staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Valentin &amp; Ferdinande, 2011)</ref>. The work of ICU nurses is characterized by the emotional and psychological demands of a high-risk situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mealer, Shelton, Berg, Rothbaum, &amp; Moss, 2007)</ref>. Therefore, in addition to the challenges faced by public sector nurses in general, ICU nurses deal daily with suffering, grief and death, all of which have the potential to adversely impact their psychological states.</p><p>Against this backdrop, this study qualitatively explored the expectations and experiences of nurses in four ICUs in a South African hospital in the public sector through the lens of the psychological contract. The psychological contract has been defined as "an individual's beliefs regarding the terms and conditions of a reciprocal exchange agreement between the focal person and another party" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rousseau, 1989, p. 123)</ref>. The concept was first used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Argyris (1960)</ref> to describe the expectations that arise between an employee and employer. These expectations and obligations are also understood to be mutual and implicit <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schein, 1965)</ref>. The psychological contract is considered a significant regulator of the employment relationship and is shaped by the attitudes and behaviours of the parties to it. Knowing the content and identifying the most prominent perceived expectations will provide a basis for maintaining a positive psychological contract amongst ICU nurses. Employee attitude, motivation, organisational commitment and trust are impacted by the degree to which contracts are fulfilled or breached <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guest &amp; Conway, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Where breach has occurred, it can be extremely difficult to rebuild the trust relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Conway, Guest, &amp; Trenberth, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Although there are several general studies examining the relationships between nurses and their managers, few explore the employeremployee bond in a qualitative form or examine nurses' experiences through the lens of the psychological contract. To the researcher's knowledge, this study is the first of its kind in South Africa to apply the construct to this research setting. The study extends the work of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jones &amp; Sambrook, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McCabe &amp; Sambrook, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Suazo, Turnley, &amp; Mai‐Dalton, 2008)</ref> and further advances a practical understanding of the psychological contract through revealing the underlying dynamics of the ICU nurses’ work relationships. This article aims to provide insight into the content, fulfilment and potential breach of ICU nurses’ psychological contracts. Having this nuanced understanding can highlight steps to be taken to ensure productive and effective working relationships and improve the retention of this specialist group of health professionals in South Africa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| BACKGROUND</head><p>Two main types of psychological contract are found: transactional (characterized by narrow scope and specific exchanges) and relational (categorized by trust, belief and fairness). The more relational the psychological contract becomes, the less transactional, and viceversa <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Conway &amp; Briner, 2005)</ref>. A hybrid of these two types is known as the balanced contract where key elements include the enhancement of employee skills and employability. The formation of the psychological contract begins in the pre-employment stage. For nurses, this starts with being drawn to the profession <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jones &amp; Sambrook, 2010)</ref> and is further modified as they move through their hospital training and placement. The Code of Ethics for Nursing Practitioners in South Africa outlines the duties and responsibilities associated with the profession in detail, highlighting the importance of elements such as "kindness", "altruism" and "concern" in day to day activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(South African Nursing Council [SANC], 2013)</ref>. For ICU nurses, the ethical practices extend to end-of-life issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(SANC, 2014)</ref>. The inherent characteristics associated with the profession, coupled with the current issues within the South African public healthcare system, mean that motivation and ability to perform well in the ICU are challenged on an ongoing basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Van der Colff &amp; Rothmann, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The state of the relationship between the nursing manager and the ICU nurse is a critical factor in shaping the psychological contract as employees often treat the behaviour of their direct supervisors as the "personification" of the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Suazo et al., 2008)</ref>. The role of the line manager is particularly important in building trust-a central component to the fulfilment of the psychological contract <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McCabe &amp; Sambrook, 2014)</ref>. Nurses expect management to grant them a level of independence through showing trust and confidence in their abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Corder &amp; Ronnie, 2018)</ref>. Autonomy is another key theme in contributing to greater organisational commitment and performance amongst nurses. Autonomy in this sense may include easier access to information, more open channels of communication and the availability of the tools necessary for the job as well as recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gilbert, Laschinger, &amp; Leiter, 2010)</ref>. This allows nurses to become more empowered, to create greater meaning in their work and to lead to elevated levels of job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">| METHODS</head><p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 44 nurses at a public, tertiary hospital in South Africa. Nurses in four ICU wards at the hospital were approached with a request for an interview.</p><p>Fifteen nurses declined to participate in the study. Interviews were conducted during both day and night shifts in a private room outside each of the ICU wards. Interviews were recorded with the consent of the interviewees and later transcribed. The interviews-which lasted between 15 and 33 min-comprised two sections: (a) demographic information linked to their job category and nursing experience and (b) semi-structured questions related to their psychological contract.</p><p>Because the Psychological Contract Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rousseau, 2000)</ref> is a well-established and validated measure used for quantitative research, this study drew on the tool to establish the content elements of the psychological contract through asking "What commitments or obligations have you made to the hospital, to your manager?"</p><p>The critical incident technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Butterfield, Borgen, Amundson, &amp; Maglio, 2005)</ref> was also used. Nurses were asked to recollect an incident(s) where a fellow health professional, nursing manager or the hospital went beyond or fell short of what could reasonably be expected of them. Examples of the questions posed to each ICU nurse were as follows:</p><p>• Think back to a time when a manager met or exceeded your expectations. What were the circumstances? How did this make you feel?</p><p>• Think back to a time or incident when you felt that you all worked as a team in the ICU. What about this experience made you feel like this?</p><p>• To explore possible breach, the following question was posed:</p><p>• Think back to a time when you felt disappointed or let down by a manager. What were the circumstances? How did this make you feel?</p><p>Where responses were limited, the researcher followed up with a series of probing questions. This process is in line with techniques described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bryman and Bell (2014)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| The sample</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="tab_0">1</ref> presents an overview of the 44 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Data analysis</head><p>Template analysis, a form of thematic analysis, was used to identify the prevalent content elements of the psychological contract, to establish whether ICU nurses' contracts were fulfilled, and if any instances of breach were experienced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">King and Brooks (2017)</ref> describe template analysis as a flexible technique that allows the use of a priori themes, that is those themes that are determined as helpful to the analysis before the coding process begins. In respect of this study, the psychological contract is a well-developed construct and is precisely defined. Thus, the a priori themes were easily defined.</p><p>As was the case in this study, these themes are regarded as tentative and can be redefined if found unsuitable. Although iterative in nature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Brooks, McCluskey, Turley, and King (2015)</ref> provide guidelines to be followed with this method. This consists of the following steps: familiarity with the data; preliminary coding of the data; cluster of the data into emergent themes; initial template definition; apply and modify the initial template; and finalize the template and apply to entire dataset.</p><p>In addition to the template analysis, manifest content analysis was utilized to establish the numeric frequency of responses and present a global view of the nurse cohort's views <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bryman &amp; Bell, 2014)</ref>. A fellow researcher, external to the study, was approached to independently code a randomly selected set of nine transcripts to determine reliability and validity. Disagreements arose around the assigned meaning of seven of the 46 coded items from the nine transcripts (10.8%). These discrepancies were discussed until consensus was established. The insights of this process informed the final analytic template. Although data saturation was reached after 28 interviews, it was decided to interview the entire cohort as these interviews had already been scheduled and ICU nurses were interested in participating in the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| Trustworthiness and credibility</head><p>The first strategy to enhance credibility was the use of an external researcher to review the coding process and provide an alternative perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2019)</ref>. This ensured the analytic template that was used was robust. An audit trail-the second strategy to enhance trustworthiness and credibility-was established through detailing the key methodological steps and decision points as they occurred. At the completion of the analytic process, the findings were presented to two focus groups of interviewed nurses to ensure accuracy and check for resonance through a member checking process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Birt, Scott, Cavers, Campbell, &amp; Walter, 2016)</ref>. This final strategy thus also improved trustworthiness of the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">| Ethical considerations</head><p>As per the ethics agreement between the researcher, the university and the relevant health authorities, anonymity of respondents and the health institution was assured and confidentiality of data was maintained. Informed consent was obtained from each participant at the start of each interview when they were also informed of the voluntary nature of the study. Where interview extracts are used, names have been changed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">| Content elements of ICU nurses' psychological contracts</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">| Relational elements</head><p>Thirty-six of the 44 ICU nurses valued elements such as trust, mutual respect, affirmation, and loyalty and support. Being autonomous was one way that trust was experienced. Shelley (RN) explained: "My manager does trust us; she leaves us alone and she knows the work will be done". Privacy and discretion in inter-personal discussions were a further component of trust where "I have a lot of trust in him [the manager] because everything we discuss is confidential" (Marion, EN).</p><p>Respect and the manner of the interaction were vital to Noreen (ENA): "I like to be approached in a professional manner. That shows respect. In return, I show respect to him”. This sentiment was echoed by Dolly (EN) who noted: “We are all adults here and respect from 
both sides goes a long way”. Implicit in the nurses’ explanation of respect was honesty as “that is what I expect, and I give it in return” (Pat, EN).</p><p>Affirmation was desired in mostly explicit ways. Rhiyana (RN) felt that acknowledgement through being told “You've done a great job today; I see you're a hard worker” was essential while “writing down the thanks in a little note for going the extra mile” showed both peers and other managers that Fezile's (ENA) work was appreciated. Twenty‐eight nurses felt that praise was a key motivator and that “it's not about the money” (Rebecca, RN).</p>
<p>Loyalty and support between ICU nurses and their immediate managers were considered crucial. Sintle (ENA) felt strongly about his manager's adherence to ICU protocols and appreciated that "he speaks up on our behalf and challenges senior management".</p><p>It did not matter whether the interaction between nurse manager and hospital management was successful as "even if he doesn't win the battle for all of us, we want to see him try" (Sintle). Lolly (ENA) described the manager's desired and expected role as one was the input of all staff should be listened to and acted upon. This action would show the commitment and support of the manager towards their nursing team, she explained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">| Balanced elements</head><p>Access to further education and training was considered essential by 30 participants. Although regular weekly sessions highlighting innovative and new procedures and changes in protocol were already being conducted with all ICU nurses, nurses wanted training and development to include off‐site courses. Some felt strongly that “we'd like to choose the course we want to do” (Sarah, RN) suggesting autonomy was desired around this aspect rather than it being purely management's decision. The desire for lifelong learning was linked to promotional opportunities through “being encouraged by the manager to take a challenge as an opportunity to progress” (Lorraine, RN) and explicitly being “inspired to study further and advance to the next level” (Joe, ENA).</p><p>Visibility and presence of management were raised by 16 ICU nurses including Kuhle (EN) who described the importance of the manager being seen “come to the unit and see what is going on; don't just stay in your office”. This view found support from Gino (RN) as managers often “talk about the problem without really knowing—or seeing—what is going on”. Nurses wanted their managers to communicate with them rather than rely solely on information throughtions, Judy (RN) replied, “I honestly wish that I could say yes, but charts and forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">| Transactional elements</head><p>Twelve nurses with a significant number of years in public nursing reflected that the workload was increasing with "people not getting replaced" (Polly, RN). Ruth (EN) added that "the paperwork has increased too" and questioned whether the time might be better spent "doing more patient care". Agency nurses were brought in to deal with the workload challenges but lacked ICU training, placing a further burden on permanent staff. The key concern was that, if the issue of overload was left unattended, "nurses will burnout" (Ayesha, EN) or "become de-motivated" (Carl, RN). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">| Psychological content fulfilment: Meeting expectations</head><p>Eighteen nurses could not immediately provide examples of where their management had met or exceeded their expectations although all claimed that they were on good terms with their immediate manager. Shirley (EN) explained: “She's never told me that she doesn't like the work I do. I think she's happy with my work”. For some ICU nurses, this lack of managerial affirmation was not viewed as a negative but rather “something I”ve learnt to deal with. She's like that with all the staff’ (Alice, RN) and “I am heard when I need to be and I”m very comfortable working here’ (Zola, EN).</p><p>Fourteen nurses cited examples of their psychological contract being fulfilled by nursing management. Lisa (ENA) recounted an instance where her manager had “gone out of her way—many times—to help me”. This practical form of support encouraged Lisa to “go the extra mile” in her daily duties. Marion (EN) and Joe (ENA) concurred, saying, respectively, “her warmth made me feel at home” and “I have a fantastic relationship with him; he is so approachable”. Lorraine (RN) also noted that “we can sit and talk like a family”.</p><p>The notion of “family” speaks to the fulfilment of Lorraine's psychological contract through her relationship with other parties beside her immediate manager, namely her fellow ICU nurses. Twenty nurses highlighted the importance of peers providing emotional support, hands-on training and practical help. Teamwork was thus an essential component for the fulfilment of these nurses’ psychological contracts.</p><p>ICU patients also provided contract fulfilment for 13 nurses. As Gino (RN) explained, “patients’ thanks mean the world”. “Seeing my patients improve makes it all worthwhile” agreed Lynn (ENA). A further two nurses spoke of patients returning to the ICU ward to bring cards and flowers to them, gestures much appreciated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">4.3 | Psychological content breach: Unmet expectations and broken promises</head><p>In response to the question of her manager meeting her expectations, Judy (RN) replied, “I honestly wish that I could say yes, but I can’t”. Judy, along with 11 other nurses, cited examples of psychological contract breach. These incidences ranged from a lack of fairness to an absence of trust and public reprimands. June (ENA) was fearful of her manager: “I am scared to go to the sister. But I won’t let her affect my work”. This fear resulted from being unjustifiably blamed for an incident involving a patient, and June became reluctant to ask questions or share her medical concerns with her manager.</p><p>Peter (ENA) described how his trust had been broken when he had shared his financial troubles with his manager and it became public knowledge: “It's tough when it comes to personal issues, because you don't want others to know.” Peter acknowledged that he had felt betrayed after this incident and that the relationship with his manager was now very formal and transactional. Ruth (EN), in recounting her story of being micro-managed and constantly belittled, asked: “How can I be committed if I’m not trusted?” Sophia (RN), who had been overlooked for promotion on three occasions, suggested that managers “stop favouritism, telling stories and being duplicitous.”</p><p>The most disturbing issues of breach centred on public reprimands, cited by 4 nurses. Khanyise (RN) reported that her manager had shouted: “You people don't know what you're doing; you just do it for the sake of doing it.” She was visibly upset and said, “I felt ashamed of being shouted at in public. She never once apologised.” Barbara (RN) felt strongly that this behaviour was wrong and that managers should not “shout at the staff in front of the relatives and patients (but) explain the problem privately.” Soraya (EN) shared that “this kind of behaviour makes you feel like you don't belong here.”</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">| DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">| Psychological contracts of ICU nurses</head><p>Over 80% of nurses in this study sought relational psychological contracts. Respect underpinned the professional nature of desired communication between ICU nurses and their management. Integrity was a key component involving both privacy and discretion especially in personal matters. Within the high pressurized working environment of the ICU, nurses also wanted to be publicly affirmed and considered this a key motivator. In keeping with earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(McCabe &amp; Sambrook, 2014)</ref>, loyalty and public support from nursing managers appeared to be crucial to a successful working relationship.</p><p>Other aspects, such as continuing education and training, management visibility and workload, are associated with balanced psychological contracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rousseau, 1989)</ref>. In the accounts provided by these nurses, almost 70% desired ongoing training. Nursing management also showed support for nurses' further advancement and career progression. This is critical as ICU nurses need to be at the forefront of medical practices to deliver up-to-date and professional care.</p><p>It may be argued that the nature of the work environment, with its high levels of stress and risk, is best managed through the presence of the senior health professional. Nurses appeared to feel aggrieved by managers who made decisions from their offices without knowing the on-the-ground situation. Workload, highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pillay (2009)</ref> as a major influence on dissatisfaction for nurses, was raised as a factor influencing the psychological contract. The sense of being overwhelmed and having additional responsibilities through training inexperienced nurses made ICU nurses feel as if their core purpose of serving the patient was being undermined.</p><p>This echoes findings from nurse managers themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Matlakala &amp; Botha, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">| Fulfilment of psychological contracts</head><p>Less than a third of the sample were able to cite examples of fulfilment from nursing managers, and 40% could not readily recall any incidents where their managers had met or exceeded their expectations. The examples of fulfilment centred on the manager’s support, approachability, and sincerity. Lack of any explicit collegiality did not distress some nurses, however. This may possibly indicate that those nurses tended towards more transactional-type psychological contracts.</p><p>Almost half of the ICU nurses indicated that support and co-operation from their colleagues were significant aspects of their work lives. The importance of teamwork implied high commitment, high integration, and relational interdependency, all hallmarks of peer-to-peer psychological contracts. Fellow nurses can thus be considered important shapers of the ICU nurses’ psychological contract. In addition, a third of the nurse participants’ psychological contracts were met by the patients themselves through improved patient health and receipt of positive feedback and recognition. The focus on meaningful relationships with patients is a core component of relational psychological contracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jones &amp; Sambrook, 2010)</ref> and contributes to the well-being, general satisfaction, and overall motivation of ICU nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Siffleet, Williams, Rapley, &amp; Slatyer, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">| Breach of psychological contracts</head><p>Just over a quarter of ICU nurses reported non-fulfilment of their psychological contracts. There is however a distinction between breach and violation as the former has a potentially short-term effect and the latter a greater and more systemic consequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Conway et al., 2011)</ref>. Unfairness, fear, betrayal and demeaning behaviours were all examples of breach; however, these could be considered potential violations as nurses cited longer-term consequences such as withdrawal, suspicion, alienation and a lack of commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">| CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study addressed a critical empirical gap through the qualitative exploration of the psychological contract of ICU nurses in South Africa. An original insight from this study was a strong expression for ongoing training from nurses. This desire does not merely highlight nurses' perceptions of their personal shortcomings but points to a sense of responsibility to train those less experienced in the ICU. A further novel insight from this study was that peer-to-peer contracts between ICU nurses are highlighted as crucial to workplace relationships. Both aspects are critical as they impact nurses' core purpose of patient care in a challenging and demanding ICU environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mealer et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The challenges presented by the South African healthcare system, coupled with changing workplace dynamics, have important implications for the psychological contract and subsequent motivation and retention levels of ICU nurses. Nurse managers need to understand the role they must play as leaders and as influencers. If fulfilled, the relational contract—desired by most ICU nurses in this study—has the most potential to increase loyalty and overall commitment levels. This would translate not only into better care for the most vulnerable patients but should also mitigate any intention to leave the public sector or the nursing profession itself. This is crucial given the nursing shortage facing South Africa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">| Implications for nursing management</head><p>The findings of this study suggest several avenues for improvement. Knowing the content of the psychological contract can assist nursing management in interacting with ICU nurses to ensure that their psychological contract remains positive and fulfilled. The practical suggestions from the nurses with regard to their daily working lives, such as public and private appreciation, management visibility, autonomy and discretion, are all within the ambit of nursing management. As the nurse manager is in control of creating a culture of respect and support within the work environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Laschinger, 2010)</ref>, a commitment to be present, communicative and supportive is required. Leadership training that targets communication, negotiation and inter‐personal skills may address any shortfalls in this regard <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Corder &amp; Ronnie, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>ICU nurses may feel powerless to change their employer's behaviour in the face of contract breach. Employment relationships in healthcare occur in a historically hierarchal culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hull, 2012)</ref> and make it is likely that nurses will react to contract breach in a repressed manner. This raises serious concerns for nursing management as ICU nurses may not voice their dissatisfaction over a perceived contract breach, making it difficult to ascertain the reasons for negative behavioural changes and decreased performance. While previous research has suggested that management of the psychological contract lies firmly within the ambit of the employer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Nadin &amp; Williams, 2012)</ref>, these findings indicate that productive peer-to-peer contracts between ICU nurses are also central to good working relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Laschinger (2010)</ref> argued that teamwork is essential amongst nurses because delivery of care may be compromised where there are non-supportive collegial working environments. This collaboration is even more critical in an intensive care context where mutual respect can be a buffer against the daily stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Siffleet et al., 2015)</ref>. Nursing management therefore has a role to play in ensuring harmonious team relationships.</p></div>
