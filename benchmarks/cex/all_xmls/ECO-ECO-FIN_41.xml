<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Suppose we observe some pieces of news. How might we quantify the amount of information contained in each piece? One desideratum might be that the measure should correspond to the instrumental value of information for some decision problem. Another approach would be to specify that the measure should satisfy the following properties: (i) news cannot contain a negative amount of information, (ii) news that does not affect beliefs generates no information, and (iii) the order in which the news is read does not, on average, change the total amount of information generated. The first result of this paper is that these two approaches are equivalent. A measure of information reflects instrumental value for some decision-maker if and only if it satisfies the three aforementioned properties. We call such measures of information valid.</p><p>A related question is: how might we quantify uncertainty of a belief? Again, one approach would be to measure uncertainty by its instrumental cost, i.e., by the extent to which it reduces a decision-maker’s utility relative to an omniscient benchmark. Another approach would couple the measure of uncertainty to some valid measure of information and insist that, on average, observing news reduces uncertainty to the extent that it generates information. We show that these two approaches are equivalent: a (suitably normalized) measure of uncertainty reflects the instrumental cost for some decision-maker if and only if the expected reduction in uncertainty always equals the expected amount of information generated (by a valid measure). We call such measures of uncertainty valid. In fact, every concave function that is zero at degenerate beliefs is a valid measure of uncertainty.</p><p>These results have various implications. First, they tell us that some seemingly sensible ways of measuring information, such as the Euclidean distance between the prior and the posterior, are not valid (under our definition of this term). In fact, no metric is valid: there does not exist a decision problem with an instrumental value of information that is a metric on beliefs. Second, our results provide novel decision-theoretic foundations for standard measures of information and uncertainty, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy or quadratic distance and variance. Finally, our results introduce a notion of “coupling” between measures of information and measures of uncertainty that reflects the fact Kullback-Leibler divergence complements entropy while quadratic distance complements variance. In fact, every valid measure of information is coupled with a unique valid measure of uncertainty (and vice versa), but we cannot mix and match. We also derive a functional form that pins down the measure of uncertainty coupled with a given measure of information and vice versa. These functional forms in turn provide an easy way of verifying whether a given measure of information is valid.</p><p>In contrast to much of the existing literature, we focus on ex post rather than ex ante measures of information. Taking a decision problem as given, it is straightforward to quantify the ex ante instrumental value of a Blackwell experiment, i.e., of a news generating process. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> The literature on rational inattention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sims 2003)</ref> also takes the ex ante perspective and associates the cost of information acquisition/processing with the expected reduction in entropy. The cost functions used in the rational inattention models have been generalized along a number of dimensions, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> but these generalizations typically still assume that the cost of an experiment is proportional to the expected reduction of some measure of uncertainty. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> Such cost functions inherently take an ex ante perspective since it is always possible that entropy (or any other measure of uncertainty) increases after some piece of news. Our approach maintains the feature that the ex ante amount of information coincides with the ex ante reduction in uncertainty, but in contrast to existing work, we ensure that the quantity of information generated is always positive, even from the ex post perspective.</p><p>Our approach, which links measures of information and uncertainty to underlying decision problems, introduces a natural notion of equivalence of decision problems (or collections of decision problems). We say two collections of decision problems are equivalent if they induce the same measure of uncertainty. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> We show that, when the state space is binary, every decision problem is equivalent to a collection of simple decision problems, i.e., problems where the decision-maker needs to match a binary action to the state. Finally, we establish that the measures of information we term valid coincide with the set of incentive-compatible payment schemes in a class of dynamic information-elicitation environments.</p></div>

We follow the formalization of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Green and Stokey (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gentzkow and Kamenica (2017)</ref> and define a signal π as a finite partition of Ω × [0, 1] s.t. π ⊂ S, where S is the set of non-empty Lebesgue-measurable subsets of Ω × [0, 1]. We refer to an element s ∈ S as a signal realization. The interpretation is that a random variable x drawn uniformly from [0, 1] determines the signal realization conditional on the state; the probability of observing s ∈ π in ω is the Lebesgue measure of {x ∈ [0, 1] | (ω, x) ∈ s}.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Decision problems</head><p>A decision problem D = (A, u) specifies a compact action set A and a continuous utility function u : A × Ω → R ∪ {−∞}. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> Given a decision problem D = (A, u), a value of information for D, denoted vD : ∆ (Ω) × ∆ (Ω) → R, is given by <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">foot_8</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v𝒟(p,q) = 𝔼p[u(a*(p),ω)] − 𝔼p[u(a*(q),ω)]</formula><p>where for belief q, a * (q) ∈ arg max a∈A E q [u (a, ω)].<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">foot_9</ref> From the perspective of an agent with belief p, the payoff to a * (q) is E p [u (a * (q) , ω)] whereas the payoff from taking the "correct" action given this belief is max a∈A E p [u (a, ω)]. Thus, v D (p, q) captures the ex post value of updating beliefs from q to p for a decision-maker who faces the decision problem D.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_10">foot_10</ref> If u is denominated in money, we can think of v D (p, q) as the greatest price at which the decision-maker could have purchased a signal that moved her belief from q to p such that she does not regret the purchase.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">foot_11</ref> Another interpretation of v D (p, q) is the instrumental loss from believing q when available data indicates p, as in models of belief-based utility that emphasize potential optimality of inaccurate beliefs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Caplin and Leahy 2001,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brunnermeier and Parker 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The cost of uncertainty for D = (A, u) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">C D (q) = E q max a u (a, ω) -max a E q [u (a, ω)]</formula>.<p>The term E q [max a [u (a, ω)]] is the expected payoff to the decision-maker if she were to learn the true state of the world before taking the action. The term max a [E q [u (a, ω)]] is the expected payoff from the action that is optimal given belief q. Thus, the cost of uncertainty simply reflects how much lower the decision-maker's payoff is because she does not know the state of the world. This function is sometimes also called the expected value of perfect information.</p><p>Example 1. (Simple decision problem) Consider a decision problem with two actions a ∈ {0,1}, each of which is optimal in the corresponding state of the world ω ∈ {0,1}. We call such a problem simple. Normalizing the payoff of a=0 to zero in both states, a=1 is an optimal action if qu(1,1) + (1-q)u(1,0) ≥ 0, i.e., q ≥ r ≡ -u(1,0)/(u(1,1)-u(1,0)), where q denotes probability of ω=1. We can further normalize the denominator u(1,1)-u(1,0) to 1, which yields utility function uʳ given by uʳ(1,1)=1-r and uʳ(1,0)=-r (with uʳ(0,0)=uʳ(0,1)=0). Thus, every simple decision problem is characterized by some r ∈ [0,1] and is denoted 𝒟ʳ..</p><p>Any value of information for 𝒟ʳ equals |p-r| if r ∈ (min{p,q}, max{p,q}) (i.e., r is strictly between p and q) and zero if r &gt; max{p,q} or r &lt; min{p,q}. To see this, note that if r is not between p and q, the optimal action does not change so the value of information is zero. If q &lt; r &lt; p, the optimal action switches from 0 to 1, and the value of information is pu(1,1) + (1-p)u(1,0) = (p-r)u(1,1) + ((1-p)-(1-r))u(1,0) = (p-r)(u(1,1)-u(1,0)) = p-r. Likewise, if p &lt; r &lt; q, the optimal action switches from 1 to 0, and the value of information is (r-p). Thus, when r is between p and q, value of information is proportional to |p-r|. When q=r, we have flexibility in specifying the value of information since it depends on the way the decision-maker breaks her indifference. For concreteness, we suppose the decision-maker takes the two actions with equal probability, which yields the value of |p-r|/2. Hence, a value of information for 𝒟ʳ is vʳ(p,q) = |p-r| if r ∈ (min{p,q}, max{p,q}), |p-r|/2 if r=q, 0 otherwise. Note that, under vʳ, belief movements that are "similar" do not necessarily generate similar value: if the cutoff belief is r = 0.5, moving from 0.49 to 0.9 generates much more value than moving from 0.51 to 0.9 since the former changes the action to the ex post optimal one whereas the latter leaves the action unchanged.</p> <p>The cost of uncertainty for problem 𝒟ʳ is the triangular function Cʳ(q) = q(1-r) if q ≤ r, (1-q)r if q &gt; r.</p><p>Example 2. (Quadratic loss estimation) Suppose A = co (Ω) ⊂ R and u Q (a, ω) = -(a -ω) 2</p><p>where co denotes convex hull. The optimal action given belief q is E q [ω], the value of information is <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">foot_12</ref> v Q (p, q) = (Ep [ω] − Eq [ω])2 , and the cost of uncertainty is <ref type="foot" target="#foot_13">foot_13</ref> C Q (q) = Varq [ω].</p><p>Example 3. (Brier elicitation) Consider some arbitrary (finite) Ω, let A = ∆ (Ω), and suppose uB (a, ω) = −ka−δω k2 , where k·k denotes the Euclidean norm. In other words, the action is a report of a probability distribution, and the utility is the <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brier score (1950)</ref> of the accuracy of the report. The optimal action given belief q is to set a = q, the value of information is v B (p, q) = p -q 2 , and the cost of uncertainty is C B (q) = ω q ω (1 -q ω ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ely et al. (2015)</ref> refer to C B as residual variance.</p><p>Note that quadratic loss estimation coincides with Brier elicitation (subject to a scaling factor)</p><p>when the state space is binary.</p></div>

Measures of information can also depend only on some some “summary statistic”, e.g., if Ω ⊂ R, we might set d (p, q) = (E p [ω] -E q [ω]) 2 . Finally, note that a measure of information need not be symmetric, e.g., it might be Kullback-Leibler divergence, ω p ω log p ω q ω .</p><p>Commonly encountered measures of uncertainty include variance H (q) = Var q [ω] (when Ω ⊂ R) and Shannon entropy H (q) =ω q ω log q ω .</p><p>We are interested in whether the aforementioned (and other) measures of information and uncertainty quantify attitudes toward information in some decision problem.

We introduce two notions of consistency. Say that d and H are jointly valid if they arise from the same decision problem, i.e., there is a decision problem D such that d is a value of information for D and H is the cost of uncertainty for D. We say that d and H are coupled if for any prior q and any signal π s , we have E [d (q (s) , q)] = E [H (q) -H (q (s))]; in other words, the expected amount of information generated equals the expected reduction in uncertainty.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_16">foot_16</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Main results</head><p>In this section, we answer the two questions posed at the end of the previous section: (i) which measures of information and uncertainty are valid, and (ii) which measures of information and uncertainty are consistent with each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Valid measures of information</head><p>Consider the following potential properties of a measure of information.</p><p>(Null-information) d (q, q) = 0 ∀q.</p><p>(Positivity) d (p, q) ≥ 0 ∀ (p, q).</p><p>(Order-invariance) Given any prior and pair of signals, the expected sum of information generated by the two signals is independent of the order in which they are observed. Formally, for any q, πα , and πβ , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝔼[d(q(α),q) + d(q(α∩β),q(α))] = 𝔼[d(q(β),q) + d(q(α∩β),q(β))]</formula>.<p>Null-information and Positivity impose ex post properties on the realized amount of information while Order-invariance imposes an ex ante property regarding the expected amount of information that will be generated.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_17">foot_17</ref></p><p>In our approach, a measure of information is a function of just the prior and the posterior. This means that it explicitly excludes news that does not affect the posterior. In other words, it does not ascribe value to news that is useful only insofar as it changes the interpretation of other signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Börgers et al. 2013)</ref>. Accordingly, Null-information states that news that does not change beliefs does not generate information.</p><p>Positivity requires that the amount of information received is always weakly positive, even from the ex post perspective. This puts it in contrast with the approach common in information theoryand often used in the economics literature on rational inattention (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sims 2003)</ref> -that measures information as the expected reduction in entropy. Because a particular piece of news can increase entropy, ex post information measured by reduction in entropy can be negative.</p><p>Order-invariance concerns sequences of signals. It echoes a crucial feature of Bayesian updating, namely that the order in which information is observed cannot affect its overall content. That is, observing π α followed by π β leads to the same final distribution of posteriors as observing π β followed by π α . Order-invariance requires that these two sequences therefore must generate the same expected sum of ex post information. While Order-invariance is stated in terms of pairs of signals, in combination with Null-information, it guarantees that sequences of any number of signals that lead to the same final distribution of posteriors necessarily generate the same expected sum of information.</p><p>Theorem 1. A measure of information is valid if and only if it satisfies Null-information, Positivity, and Order-invariance.</p><p>Proofs are postponed until Section 3.6. A property closely related to Order-invariance would be that the expected sum of information generated by observing one signal and then the other is the same as the expected amount of information generated by observing the two signals at once. Formally, say that d satisfies Combination-invariance if for any q, π α , and π β , we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝔼[d(q(α),q) + d(q(α∩β),q(α))] = 𝔼[d(q(α∩β),q)]</formula>.<p>It turns out that Combination-invariance is equivalent to Null-information and Order-invariance (cf: Appendix A). Therefore, Theorem 1 can alternatively be stated in terms of Positivity and Combination-invariance.</p><p>Theorem 1 not only identifies the precise set of properties that a measure of information compatible with a decision-theoretic foundation must satisfy, it also provides an easy way to test whether a given measure is valid or not. It is of course straightforward to check Null-information and Positivity, and in Section 3.4 we establish two simple tests for Order-invariance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Valid measures of uncertainty</head><p>It is easy to see that for any decision problem, the cost of uncertainty is concave and equal to zero when the decision-maker knows the state. It turns out that these two properties are not only necessary but sufficient for validity. Formally, consider the following two properties:</p><p>(Null-uncertainty) H (δ ω ) = 0 for all ω, (Concavity) H is concave.</p><p>Theorem 2. A measure of uncertainty is valid if and only if it satisfies Null-uncertainty and Concavity.</p><p>Note that Null-uncertainty and Concavity jointly imply that H is positive everywhere. Moreover, the concavity of H implies that observing any signal necessarily reduces expected uncertainty, i.e., for any q and πs , E [H (q (s))] ≤ H (q).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Consistency of measures of information and uncertainty</head><p>In Section 2.3, we introduced two distinct notions of consistency, joint validity and coupling. Here we show that (given valid measures of information and uncertainty), these two notions of consistency coincide. Moreover, there are specific functional forms that relate the two measures.</p><p>Recall that a supergradient of a concave function H at belief q is a vector ∇H (q) such that for any belief p we have H (q) + ∇H (q) · (p − q) ≥ H (p). For any concave function, ∇H (q) exists for all q. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_18">foot_18</ref> When H is smooth at q, ∇H (q) is unique and equal to H 0 (q). A Bregman divergence of a concave function H is a function from (p, q) to the real numbers equal to H (q) − H (p) + ∇H (q) · (p − q) for some supergradient ∇H (q) of H at q <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bregman 1967)</ref>.</p><p>Theorem 3. Given a valid measure of information d and a valid measure of uncertainty H, the following are equivalent: (1) d and H are jointly valid, (2) d and H are coupled, (3) d is a Bregman divergence of H, (4) H (q) = ω q ω d (δω , q). Moreover, as Propositions 3 and 4 below clarify, given any valid H, d is jointly valid with H if and only if it is the Bregman divergence <ref type="foot" target="#foot_19">foot_19</ref> of H, and given any valid d, H is jointly valid with d if and only if H (q) = ω q ω d (δω , q).</p><p>Note that the relationship between d and H expressed by part (4) of Theorem 3 has a simple interpretation: uncertainty is the expected amount of information generated by observing a fully revealing signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Checking validity</head><p>Theorem 2 provides an easy way to confirm whether a given measure of uncertainty is valid. Applying Theorem 1 to check whether a given measure of information is valid may not seem as straightforward because it requires checking Order-invariance, which is not a self-evident property. Fortunately, however, there are two ways around this issue.</p><p>First, if a measure of information is smooth, it is possible to confirm whether it satisfies Order-invariance simply by inspecting its derivatives:</p><p>Proposition 1. Suppose a measure of information d is twice-differentiable in p for all q and 2 d(p,q) satisfies Null-information. Then, d satisfies Order-invariance if and only if ∂ ∂p is independent of q.</p><p>Second, the functional forms from Theorem 3 provide an easy way to check whether a measure of information (smooth or not) satisfies Order-invariance.</p><p>Proposition 2. Suppose a measure of information d satisfies Null-information and Positivity.</p><p>Then, d satisfies Order-invariance if and only if d is a Bregman divergence of ∑qωd(δω,q).</p><p>Proposition 2 is easily applied since confirming whether</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">d(p,q) = ∑qωd(δω,q) - ∑pωd(δω,p) + ∇(∑qωd(δω,q))·(p-q)</formula><p>is a straightforward computation for any given d. Moreover, since a Bregman divergence cannot be a metric,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_20">foot_20</ref> Proposition 2 also implies that any metric on the space of beliefs violates Orderinvariance.</p><p>Corollary 1. If a measure of information d is a metric on ∆ (Ω), it does not satisfy Orderinvariance.</p><p>Proofs of these results are in the Appendix. Corollary 1 further implies that no metric can be coupled with any measure of uncertainty, since (as shown below in Lemma 3) coupled measures necessarily satisfy Order-invariance.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_21">foot_21</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Discussion</head><p>Consider again the examples of decision problems from Section 2. Recall that the value of information for a simple decision problem with cutoff r is vʳ(p,q) = |p-r| if r ∈ (min{p,q}, max{p,q}), |p-r|/2 if r=q, 0 otherwise and the cost of uncertainty is Cʳ(q) = q(1-r) if q ≤ r, (1-q)r if q &gt; r. For quadratic loss estimation, the value of information is v Q (p, q) = (E p [ω] -E q [ω]) 2 , and the cost of uncertainty is C Q (q) = Var q [ω]. vᴮ(p,q) = ‖p-q‖² and Cᴮ(q) = ∑ω qω(1-qω).</p><p>Theorem 1 thus tells us that v r , v Q , and v B all satisfy Null-information, Positivity, and Orderinvariance,<ref type="foot" target="#foot_22">foot_22</ref> while Theorem 2 confirms that C r , C Q , and C B satisfy Null-uncertainty and Concavity. Moreover, Theorem 3 tells us that each of these pairs of measures is coupled. If we want our measure of uncertainty to be "consistent" with our measure of information (in the sense that any signal generates information to the same extent that it reduces uncertainty), then we can measure uncertainty with C r and information with v r , or we can measure uncertainty with C Q and information with v Q , etc., but we cannot "mix and match".</p><p>In fact, our results imply that every concave function (equal to zero at degenerate beliefs) is a valid measure of uncertainty and is consistent with some measure of information -namely its Bregman divergence. Take entropy -perhaps the most widely used measure of uncertainty -for example. Our results tell us that entropy H (q) =ω q ω log q ω is coupled with its Bregman divergence, which, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bregman (1967)</ref>, is Kullback-Leibler divergence, d(p,q) = ∑ω pω log(pω/qω).</p><p>For every signal, the expected reduction in entropy equals the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence. Such coupling (with a suitable measure of information) is not a special feature of entropy, but rather holds for any normalized concave function.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_23">foot_23</ref> Indeed, the fact that for any signal, the expected reduction in residual variance equals the expected quadratic distance between the prior and the posterior plays a central role in the derivation of suspense-optimal entertainment policies in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ely (2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Augenblick and Rabin (2018)</ref> also emphasize this result (cf: their Proposition 1) and use it as a cornerstone for an empirical test of rationality of belief updating. They also introduce a class of measures of uncertainty and coupled measures of information <ref type="foot" target="#foot_24">foot_24</ref> that encompass variance (coupled with quadratic distance) and entropy (coupled with Kullback-Leibler divergence). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_25">foot_25</ref></p><p>Moreover, Theorem 3 tells us that we can "microfound" any (normalized, concave) measure of uncertainty -and its coupled measure of information -as arising from some decision problem. In fact, the constructive proof of Proposition 6 provides an explicit algorithm for finding the underlying decision problem. Given the H and the d, if we set A = ∆ (Ω) and u (a, ω) = -d (δ ω , a), we obtain</p><p>H as the cost of uncertainty and d as the value of information. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_26">foot_26</ref> These decision problems can be interpreted as follows: the action is a report of a probability distribution of an unknown variable, and utility is maximized by reporting one's true belief. This interpretation elucidates the connection between our results and the literature on scoring rules. The relationship between proper scoring rules, decision problems, and Bregman divergences has previously been explored by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gneiting and Raftery (2007)</ref>.</p><p>Consider entropy. If we set A = ∆ (Ω) and u KL (a, ω) = -log a ω (letting u (a, ω) = -∞ if a ω = 0), we get entropy as the cost of uncertainty (C KL (q) =ω q ω log q ω ) and Kullback-Leibler divergence as the value of information (v KL (p, q) = p ω log p ω q ω ). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_27">foot_27</ref> This utility function corresponds to the familiar logarithmic scoring rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Good 1952)</ref>. This example also illustrates why we needed to extend the potential range of the utility function to negative infinity in our definition of decision problems (cf: footnote <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref>). Some measures of uncertainty, such as entropy, have the property that the marginal reduction of uncertainty goes to infinity as the belief approaches certainty; the extended range allows us to microfound such measures. There is no decision problem with a finite-valued utility function that has entropy as its cost of uncertainty.</p><p>That said, a decision problem that has some particular d and H as its value of information and cost of uncertainty is not unique.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_28">foot_28</ref> In information theory, entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence are often presented as arising from a decision problem that is quite different from A = ∆ (Ω) and u (a, ω) = -log a ω . If a decision-maker needs to choose a code, i.e., a map from ω to a string in some alphabet, aiming to minimize the expected length of the string, entropy arises as the cost of uncertainty and Kullback-Leibler divergence arises as the value of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cover &amp; Thomas 2012)</ref>. Our results can thus be seen as providing an alternative -and arguably simpler -decisiontheoretic microfoundation for these widely used measures. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_29">foot_29</ref> In the next section, we provide yet another foundation for entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of collections of simple decision problems. In fact, we show that (when the state space in binary), every valid measure of information or uncertainty can be expressed as arising from some collection of simple decision problems.</p><p>Our results are also useful insofar as they reveal that certain seemingly sensible measures of information are not valid, i.e., cannot be a microfoundation in our decision-theoretic terms. For example, Euclidean distance between the prior and the posterior is not a valid measure of information. While this measure satisfies Null-information and Positivity, it is easy to see that it does not satisfy Order-invariance. Under this measure, any partially informative signal followed by a fully informative signal yields a higher expected sum of information than a fully informative signal does on its own. In fact, Corollary 1 tells us that every metric violates Order-invariance. Hence, Theorem 1 implies that there does not exist a decision problem whose value of information is a metric on beliefs.</p><p>Finally, Theorem 3 highlights a geometric relationship between uncertainty and information through the Bregman divergence characterization.

Given a measure of information d that satisfies Null-information and Order-invariance, let H(q) = ∑ω qωd(δω,q). Then, H is coupled with d and satisfies Null-uncertainty.</p><p>Proof of Lemma 2. Given a measure of information d that satisfies Null-information, and Order-invariance, let H(q) = ∑ω qωd(δω,q). Consider some q and some signal πα. To show that H is coupled with d, we need to show 𝔼[d(q(α),q)] = 𝔼[H(q) - H(q(α))]. Let πβ be a fully informative signal. First, consider observing πβ followed by πα. Since πβ is fully informative, 𝔼[d(q(β),q)] = ∑ω qωd(δω,q) = H(q). Furthermore, πα cannot generate any additional information so α∩β = β, and hence by Null-information of d, we have that 𝔼[d(q(α∩β),q(β))] = 0. Thus, the expected sum of information generated by observing πβ followed by πα (i.e., 𝔼[d(q(β),q) + d(q(α∩β),q(β))]) equals H(q). Now consider observing πα followed by πβ. This generates expected sum of information equal to 𝔼[d(q(α),q) + d(q(α∩β),q(α))]. Moreover, 𝔼[d(q(α∩β),q(α))] = 𝔼[∑ω qω(α)d(δω,q(α))] = 𝔼[H(q(α))]. Hence, by Order-invariance, we have H(q) = 𝔼[d(q(α),q) + d(q(α∩β),q(α))] = 𝔼[d(q(α),q) + H(q(α))], i.e., 𝔼[d(q(α),q)] = 𝔼[H(q) - H(q(α))]. Hence, H is coupled with d. Finally, Null-information and H(q) = ∑ω qωd(δω,q) jointly imply Null-uncertainty.</p><p>We now turn to the proof of Proposition 3.</p><p>Proof of proposition 3. Consider a measure of information d that satisfies Null-information, Positivity, and Order-invariance. Let H(q) = ∑ω qωd(δω,q). To show H is concave, we need to establish that for any q and any πs, we have 𝔼[H(q) - H(q(s))] ≥ 0. By Lemma 2, we know that 𝔼[H(q) - H(q(s))] = 𝔼[d(q(s),q)]. By Positivity, d(q(s),q) ≥ 0 for any s. Hence, 𝔼[H(q) - H(q(s))] ≥ 0. It remains to show that H(q) is the unique function that is coupled with d and satisfies Null-uncertainty. Consider a fully informative signal πs and some Ĥ that is coupled with d and satisfies Null-uncertainty. We have that Ĥ(q) - 𝔼[Ĥ(q(s))] = 𝔼[d(q(s),q)] = ∑ω qωd(δω,q). Null-uncertainty implies that 𝔼[Ĥ(q(s))] = 0. Hence, Ĥ(q) = ∑ω qωd(δω,q).</p><p>Proposition 4.

Suppose some d and H are coupled. Fix any q. We know that for any signal πs, 𝔼[d(q(s),q) - H(q) + H(q(s))] = 0. Since this expression is constant across all signals, 𝔼p∼τ[d(p,q) - H(q) + H(p)] is constant across all distributions of posteriors τ s.t. 𝔼p∼τ[p] = q <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kamenica and Gentzkow 2011)</ref>. This in turn implies that d(p,q) - H(q) + H(p) is some affine function of p, f(q)p + g(q). Now, since 𝔼p∼τ[f(q)·p + g(q)] = 0 for all τ s.t. 𝔼p∼τ[p] = q, it must be that g(q) = -f(q)q. Hence, d(p,q) - H(q) + H(p) = f(q)·(p-q).</p><p>We are now ready to prove Proposition 4.</p><p>Proof of Proposition 4. We first establish the "if" direction. Consider some H that satisfies Null-uncertainty and Concavity. Let d(p,q) = H(q) - H(p) + ∇H(q)·(p-q) for some supergradient ∇H(q). Note that for any q and any πs, we have 𝔼[∇H(q)·(q(s)-q)] = 0 and thus 𝔼[d(q(s),q)] = 𝔼[H(q) - H(q(s))]. Since this holds for all signals, d is coupled with H. Next, by Lemma 3, d satisfies Order-invariance. It is obvious that d satisfies Null-information and since it is a Bregman divergence of a concave function, it satisfies Positivity. To establish the "only if" direction, consider any d that is coupled with H and satisfies Positivity. Lemma 4 shows that d(p,q) = H(q) - H(p) + f(q)·(p-q) for some function f. Positivity implies that H(q) - H(p) + f(q)·(p-q) ≥ 0 for all pairs (p,q), which means that f(q) is a supergradient of H(q).</p><p>We now turn to two Propositions that relate validity of d and H with the properties of d and H.</p><p>Proposition 5.

To establish (2), we note that 𝔼q[maxa[u(a,ω)]] is linear in q while maxa[𝔼q[u(a,ω)]] is convex in q; thus C𝒟 is concave. It is immediate that C𝒟 satisfies Null-uncertainty.

Thus, 𝔼[C𝒟(q) - C𝒟(q(s))] = 𝔼[v𝒟(q(s),q)]. Finally, to establish (1), note that Null-information and Positivity are immediate while Order-invariance follows from (3) by Lemma 3.</p><p>Proposition 6.

This result is closely related to the characterization of proper scoring rules in <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Schervish (1989)</ref>.</p><p>roposition 7. Suppose the state space is binary. Every decision problem is equivalent to some simple decision environment.</p><p>Formal proof is in the Appendix, but to get some intuition for this result, first consider a simple decision environment that puts measure 1 on some simple decision problem r. Its cost of uncertainty, as noted above, is Cʳ(q) = q(1-r) if q ≤ r, (1-q)r if q > r, i.e., a piecewise linear function with slope 1-r for q &lt; r and slope -r for q &gt; r; in other words, the decrease in slope at r is 1. Next, consider an environment that puts measure η on some simple decision problem r. Its cost of uncertainty is just ηCʳ(q) with the decrease in slope at r of η. Now, consider an environment μ = ((η1,r1),...,(ηk,rk)) that puts measure ηi on simple decision problem ri for i ∈ {1,...,k}. Its cost of uncertainty Kμ(q) is ∑i ηiCʳⁱ(q), which is a piecewise linear function whose slope decreases by ηi at each ri.</p><p>Hence, given any decision problem 𝒟 with a finite action space A - and therefore a piecewise linear cost of uncertainty C𝒟(q) - we can find an equivalent simple decision environment by putting a measure ηi = limq→ri⁻ C𝒟'(q) - limq→ri⁺ C𝒟'(q) (i.e., the decrease in slope) at each kink ri of C𝒟(q).</p><p>For example, consider A = {x,m,y} and Ω = {X,Y}, where u(a,ω) is indicated by the matrix: X Y x 1 0 m 1/3 3/4 y 0 1.</p><p>Under these preferences, x is optimal when the probability of Y is q ≤ 8/17, m is optimal for q ∈ [8/17,4/7], and y is optimal when q ≥ 4/7. Then, C𝒟(q) is piecewise linear with kinks at r1 = 8/17 and r2 = 4/7 and slope decreases of 17/12 at r1 and 7/12 at r2. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to a simple decision environment that puts measure η1 = 17/12 on r1 = 8/17 and η2 = 7/12 on r2 = 4/7.</p><p>The logic above can be extended to decision problems with a continuous action space and smooth cost of uncertainty by setting the density of the simple decision environment equal to the infinitesimal decrease in slope of C𝒟(q), i.e., -C𝒟''(q). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_32">foot_32</ref> For example, consider the decision problem A = [0,1] and Ω = {X,Y} with u(a,ω) = -a²/4 if ω=X, -(1-a)²/4 if ω=Y whose cost of uncertainty C𝒟(q) = q(1-q)/2 is proportional to residual variance. Since -C𝒟''(q) = 1 for all q, this decision problem is equivalent to a uniform measure over simple decision problems. In other words, a decision-maker who is equally likely to face any simple decision problem has value of information and cost of uncertainty proportional to quadratic variation and residual variance, respectively.</p><p>Similarly, suppose the decision-maker faces the decision problem whose cost of uncertainty is entropy, i.e., A = [0,1] and Ω = {X,Y} with u(a,ω) = -log(1-a) if ω=X, -log(a) if ω=Y. Since entropy is given by -q log q - (1-q) log(1-q), its second derivative is -1/(q(1-q)). Thus, a decision-maker has entropy-like attitude toward information and uncertainty when there is a high prevalence of simple decision problems with very low and very high cutoffs relative to those with cutoffs near 1/2. In fact, while the entropy-equivalent measure on any interval (z,ž) ⊂ (0,1) is finite, it diverges to infinity as z approaches 0 or ž approaches 1. This is the primary reason why we needed to define simple decision environments as general measures (rather than probability distributions). The formulation in terms of measures allows us to accommodate costs of uncertainty - such as entropy - that have infinite slopes at the boundary. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_33">foot_33</ref></p><p>The environments that yield residual variance and entropy as costs of uncertainty can be seen as two elements of a parametric family of measures. Consider measures with density equal to q γ (1 − q)γ for γ &gt; −2. When γ = 0, we have a uniform density and thus the cost of uncertainty is residual variance. When γ = −1, we get the density that yields entropy. For any γ > −1, the density integrates to a finite amount and thus can be scaled to a probability distribution (a symmetric Beta). For γ ≤ −1, the measure is not finite. Thus, entropy can be seen as the “border case” between measures of uncertainty that are proportionally equivalent to probability distributions and those that are only equivalent to infinite measures. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_34">foot_34</ref></p><p>Proposition 7 also provides insight into the tests of rationality proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Augenblick and Rabin (2018)</ref>. They emphasize that if a sequence of beliefs was formed through Bayes' rule, the expected sum of belief movements as measured by quadratic variation must equal residual variance of the initial belief, though as we mentioned in footnote 26, they discuss a broader (but non-comprehensive) class of tests. Our results imply that the set of all tests of Bayesian rationality that confirm expected reduction in uncertainty equals expected belief movement is spanned by picking <term>any</term> pair of functions H and f and then measuring uncertainty by H and belief movement by H(q) - H(p) + f(q)(p-q). Moreover, if one wishes to guarantee that belief movements are non-negative, H must be concave and f must be a supergradient of H.</p><p>That said, at least for the case of binary states, there is one sense in which <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Augenblick and Rabin's (2018)</ref> choice to focus on quadratic variation is the most natural. Proposition 7 establishes that every test that defines belief movement as non-negative - and thus uses a valid measure of information as its measure of belief movement - implicitly puts a certain "weight" on movements that cross specific beliefs. For example, suppose we use vʳ with r=0.5 as the measure of belief movement. If a sequence of beliefs (q0,...,qT) was formed through Bayes' rule and qT is degenerate, it must be the case that ∑t=1ᵀ v⁰·⁵(qt,qt-1) in expectation equals C⁰·⁵(q0). This test only "counts" movements that cross the belief r=0.5, ignoring all others. If we were to use Kullback-Leibler divergence as the measure of belief movement, we would implicitly be putting weight -1/(r(1-r)) on movements across r. Quadratic variation, the test used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Augenblick and Rabin (2018)</ref>, implicitly assumes uniform weights across all movements.</p></div>

There are two periods t ∈ {1, 2} and two available signals π α * (which arrives in period 1) and π β * (which arrives in period 2).

One example of a payment function that is interim but not ex ante incentive compatible is t (p, q) = kp − qk. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_37">foot_37</ref> But, there is no payment function that is ex ante but not interim incentive compatible:</p><p>Lemma 5.

One may wish to find a payment function that induces a strict preference against delay, but since Theorem 4 is an if-and-only-if result, it tells us that any payment scheme that leads to a strict preference not to delay some information necessarily induces a strict preference to delay other information. Thus, making the seller indifferent about the delay is the only way to insure incentive compatibility.</p></div>

They show each such H is coupled with d(p,q)=p(γ(q)-γ(p))+(1-p)(γ(1-q)-γ(1-p)). Measures of uncertainty that are generated this way are all symmetric around q=½, but they need not be concave nor equal to zero at degenerate beliefs. Likewise, the corresponding measures of information are not necessarily positive (even when H is concave). Thus, these measures of information and uncertainty are more restrictive than ours (due to symmetry), but are not always compatible with our decision-theoretic microfoundations (since they need not be valid).
