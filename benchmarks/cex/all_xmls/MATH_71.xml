<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Stem cells as a therapeutic measure for the treatment of different diseases have a great potential to give rise to different mature cells as they could be used to treat HIV-1 patients when provided with the convenient factors. Thus, this paper proposes a new mathematical model, represented by a system of ODEs, to study the effect of stem cell transplantation for HIV-1 patients. Since stem cells lineage passes through many stages to become more specialized cell types, investigating (theorizing) the best stage for these cells to be engrafted was needed. The proposed system of ODEs can help medicine make the right decision about the proposed therapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A virus called HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the vital organs and the cells of the human immune system, making people more vulnerable to diseases and infections. Without treatment, HIV can develop into AIDS in many cases. In the absence of therapy the virus progresses. The developing rate of the virus differs between individuals and changes according to many factors. These factors include ability of the body to fight against HIV, the age of the individual, access to healthcare, the individual's genetic inheritance, the presence of other infections, and the resistance to certain strains of HIV.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization's guidelines issued in June 2018, there is no viable cure or vaccine for HIV, but treatments can improve patients' quality of life.</p><p>When given the right treatment, some patients can live with HIV and reduce their viral load to such a degree that it is not discoverable. Studies by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) proved that in individuals who have no discoverable viral load "through sex there is effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner." Generally, people who live with HIV take a composition of medications called HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) or CART (combination antiretroviral therapy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevents or slows the virus from developing.</p><p>We can find two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more infective and more dangerous than HIV-2 as mentioned in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Also HIV-1 concretes both lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) and human T-lymphotropic virus-3 (HTLV-III). HIV-2 is largely found in West Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, according to its relatively poor capacity for transmission.</p><p>Understanding the dynamics of HIV-1 by mathematical modeling plays a basic role in medicine. All mathematical models of HIV-1 are based on the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> where they considered the interaction between four components: uninfected CD4 + T-cells, latent infected CD4 + T-cells, infected CD4 + T-cells, and the free virus. Then, many researchers modified this model such as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> where they presented the same model without the latent infected CD4 + T-cells. The models that are studied in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> focused on models interested in the dynamics of HIV and a hope for a cure for the infection.</p><p>Stem Cell Therapy. Nowadays, stem cell studies are a field of much interest, and within this area there is a need for mathematical model representation of the dynamics growth for stem cells. Inside any organism the new cells need a source, which requires a continuous role to replace the older cells, to keep the balance of homeostasis for tissue, and to react to the external ecological stresses. In each organ adult stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> are planning this important role to replace the older cells. Through its niche in the organism and its special nature, the stem cell is able to renew itself. The daughter cells are generated from the stem cells through cell divisions and will differentiate into one of any number of organ specific cell types; in this process of differentiation, they lose their initial capacity for self-renewal. Lie and Xie <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> discussed an accurate equilibrium between stem cell selfrenewal and differentiation; also they studied the way stem cells regulate the body and treat human disease. A lot of interest has also been focused on embryonic stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, a kind of stem cell from earlier in human development, and it is a smart cell that can be differentiated into any type of cells within the body.</p><p>Adult stem and embryonic cells have the same properties of proliferation, differentiation, and self-renewal. Hence, thinking about their transplantation in the patient can be a good idea to replace injured cells and help in restoring the function of damaged cells. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of this technique to regenerate some body organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. All of the abovementioned properties are a critical field within the research of stem cells. According to the recent researches that studied proliferation of stem cells, this paper introduces a mathematical model. As discussed in Henrigou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and Bonab et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, many therapies of stem cells depend on the availability of the number of the stem cells to transfer. Therefore, the representation of the rate of growth for a population of stem cells as a mathematical model will be very useful. Several models applied to stem cell proliferation as in Loeffler and Wichman <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and as in Cowan and Morris <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have been reviewed and accordingly this paper's mathematical model was constructed.</p><p>Depending on the ability of stem cells to differentiate into some of the specialized phenotypes in response to appropriate signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, this paper proposes to treat HIV-1 patients by engraftment of the type of cells able to transform to T-cells (CD4+T). Other varieties of cells were tested for restoring the heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the cornea <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and pancreatic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>This paper begins by recalling a known mathematical model for multilineage stem cells, which was used to formulate a new mathematical model of the viral dynamic of HIV-1 treatment by stem cell therapy. The study of the model enables us to choose the best stage in the lineage to engraft these cells and help medicine make the good decision.</p></div>

Let ℎ(𝑡) be the concentration of signaling molecules which depends only on the density of mature cells 𝑠 𝑛 ; thus the dynamics of a cytokine (a protein, polypeptide, or glycoprotein that are used in signaling and intracellular signaling and also aid in cell-to-cell communication in immune responses and stimulate the movement of cells towards sites of inflammation and infection) can be represented as a firstorder differential equation:𝑑ℎ/𝑑𝑡 = 𝜇(1 -ℎ -𝛾ℎ𝑠 𝑛 (𝑡)), where 𝜇 is the death rate of a mature stem cell population and 𝛾 is a +ve constant; solving this equation using the approximation of the quasi-steady state we get ℎ = ℎ 𝛾 (𝑡) = 1/(1 + 𝛾𝑠 𝑛 (𝑡)).</p><p>The stem cell lineage can be expressed as an ODEs system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑑𝑠 1 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑓 1 (ℎ (𝑡) , 𝑠 1 (𝑡)) , 𝑑𝑠 2 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑓 2 (ℎ (𝑡) , 𝑠 2 (𝑡)) + 𝑔 1 (ℎ (𝑡) , 𝑠 1 (𝑡)) , . . . 𝑑𝑠 𝑛 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑛 (ℎ (𝑡) , 𝑠 𝑛 (𝑡)) + 𝑔 𝑛-1 (ℎ (𝑡) , 𝑠 𝑛-1 (𝑡)) .<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here 𝑓 𝑖 (ℎ(𝑡), 𝑠 𝑖 (𝑡)) is the change of 𝑠 𝑖 (𝑡) that is caused by processes at the 𝑖th stage of maturation.

But if we suppose that mature cells are postmitotic (they cannot proliferate), then since 𝑓 𝑛 is accounted only for cell death, we have 𝑓 𝑛 (ℎ(𝑡), 𝑠 𝑛 (𝑡)) &lt; 0.

Then, the flux to mitosis at time 𝑡 will be 𝑝 𝑖 (𝑡)𝑠 𝑖 (𝑡). The fraction 𝑎 𝑖 (𝑡) of daughter cells dose not differentiate. Thus, the influx to cell population 𝑖 after cell division is 2𝑎 𝑖 (𝑡)𝑝 𝑖 (𝑡)𝑠 𝑖 (𝑡) and the flux to the next cell compartment is 2(1 -𝑎 𝑖 (𝑡))𝑝 𝑖 (𝑡)𝑠 𝑖 (𝑡). The flux to death at time 𝑡 is given by 𝜇 𝑖 (𝑡)𝑠 𝑖 (𝑡).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>We have formulated an n-multistage system of ODEs model to study the influence of the treatment of HIV-1 infection with stem cell transplantation. Evidently the effect of the therapy on the viral dynamics depends on the patient (depends on 𝑅 0 ).</p><p>(i) If 𝑅 0 ≤ 1, we have only one equilibrium point corresponding to the free disease case 𝑃 1 (𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑛-1 , 𝑇, 𝑇 𝑖 , 𝑉) = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 𝜆 𝑇 /𝑑 𝑇 , 0, 0), which is asymptotically stable. We can then conclude that the infected T-cells and virus particles will be cleared and the stem cells exhausted. In this case, the patient is healed</p><p>Here we can also add a comment on the best stage we can choose for the mutant cells to be transplanted on the patient.</p><p>Since all the components 𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑛-1 of the point 𝑃 1 are equal to zero, then it is better to transplant the stem cells when they are nearly transformed to mature T-cells. This result is known in the cases of corneal transplantation, skin transplantation, and cardiac disease.</p><p>(ii) If 𝑅 0 &gt; 1, the free disease case 𝑃 1 is unstable, and the infected state 𝑃 2 (𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑛-1 , 𝑇, 𝑇 𝑖 , 𝑉) = (0, 0, . . . , 0, (𝜆 𝑇 /𝑑 𝑇 )(1/𝑅 0 ), (𝑑 𝑇 𝑐 𝑉 /𝑘 𝑇 𝜋 𝑇 𝑖 )(𝑅 0 -1), (𝑑 𝑇 /𝑘 𝑇 )(𝑅 0 -1)) is asymptotically stable, which means that any HIV-1 infection for that patient will progress to chronic infection after stem cell exhaustion</p><p>Therefore, stem cell therapy will not offer a cure to that infected person (𝑅 0 &gt; 1) but simply will help delay progression to the chronic stage. If we repeat the transplantation of stem cells in a manner to prevent its exhaustion from the patient, we can prevent AIDS.</p><p>We advise medicine to try to replace the chemical drug therapy with the apparently safe stem cell therapy. But will clinical experiments meet the expectations?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Future Works</head><p>For more interest we will study a fractional order of mathematical modeling to study multistage stem cell transplantation on HIV-1 patients based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. The presence of a fractional differential order in differential equations can lead to more consistency and more accuracy to real life than the integer-order models because the fractional derivatives enable the description of the memory and hereditary properties inherent in various processes and materials. The most important property of these models is their nonlocal property which does not exist in the integer-order differential operators. We mean by this property that the next state of a model depends not only on its current state but also on all of its historical states.</p></div>		</body>
