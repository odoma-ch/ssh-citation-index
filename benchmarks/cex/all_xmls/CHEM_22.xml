<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>As a two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial, bulk g-C 3 N 4 (CNB) has a low specific surface area and weak electron transport ability, which limit its application in photocatalysis. In this paper, ultrathin porous g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CNS) have been synthesized by thermal oxidation etching of CNB. Compared with CNB, CNS possess a larger surface area of 234.65 m 2 g -1 , good dispersity in water and a high electron transfer rate. As a co-catalyst, ultra-small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with high dispersity are successfully loaded on the surface of CNS. It is found that changing the loading method of Pt NPs in the preparation step remarkably alters the efficiency for hydrogen production.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Environmental pollution and energy crisis have been increasing due to the development of modern industries and the excessive use of fossil fuels. Semiconductor photocatalytic technology plays a pivotal role as a new approach for reducing environmental damage and developing green energy, such as photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> photocatalytic selective alcohol oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and photocatalytic hydrogen production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Ever since the photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO 2 electrodes was discovered in 1972, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> TiO 2 has become the most widely used photocatalyst due to its excellent redox ability and longterm stability against photocorrosion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> However, the wide band gap (∼3.2 eV) limits the visible light hydrogen production of TiO 2 as a photocatalyst. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Therefore, development of efficient visible light responsive photocatalysts has become the research focus. So far, a variety of semiconductor photocatalysts including CdS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> WO 3 , <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Cu 2 O, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Bi 2 WO 6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and BiVO 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> have been reported. Among the visible light responsive photocatalysts, metal-free photocatalysts such as graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) have drawn great attention. As a melon-based π-conjugated polymer, g-C 3 N 4 exhibits a wide range of light response (∼450 nm) due to a narrow band gap of ∼2.7 eV. Moreover, g-C 3 N 4 possesses many excellent properties for practical applications, such as non-toxicity, low cost, extraordinary stability, and easy preparation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Nevertheless, the photocatalytic performance of g-C 3 N 4 remains unsatisfactory owing to the high recombination rate of photo-induced electron-hole pairs and the poor quantum efficiency, which greatly hinder its practical applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> Recently, it has been proved that integration of a co-catalyst with g-C 3 N 4 is an effective strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic efficiency, ascribed to the increased separation ability of electrons and holes and the decreased activation barriers of water splitting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> Platinum (Pt), with the lowest overpotential and the highest work function, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> has been believed to be the most highly effective co-catalyst for hydrogen evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Recently, uniform Pt quantum dot-decorated porous g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have been fabricated by Jiang et al., and the Pt/CN composite showed excellent catalytic activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Moreover, Wang and co-workers discussed the hydrogen production properties of Pt NPs anchored on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 in both acidic and alkaline environments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> Besides, Guan et al. reported that the Eosin Y-sensitized g-C 3 N 4 /Pt/GO nanocomposite showed excellent H 2 production performance under optimized conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Most recently, the shape effect of the Pt co-catalyst on the photocatalytic activity has been investigated by Yao's group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Most remarkably, single-atom Pt integrated with g-C 3 N 4 demonstrated catalytic activity nearly 50 times that of bare g-C 3 N 4 in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> However, loading of Pt NPs on g-C 3 N 4 is normally achieved by the photo-deposition method, which is facile and easy to operate, nevertheless, the particle size and the chemical state of Pt are hard to control during the rapid photo-reduction process. A recent study revealed that the Pt 0 co-catalyst served as an efficient hydrogen generation site, while Pt 2+ could suppress the unfavourable hydrogen back-oxidation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop an effective method to load the Pt co-catalyst with a controlled proportion of different valence states of Pt on the surface of g-C 3 N 4 , leading to a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate.</p><p>In this work, ultrathin porous g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets (CNS) were fabricated by thermal exploitation of bulk g-C 3 N 4 (CNB). Pt NPs were successfully anchored on the surface of CNS by either a chemical reduction (CR) or a photoreduction (PR) method at room temperature. Due to the large specific surface area of CNS, Pt NPs were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the CNS and exposed more active sites, leading to the increased utilization efficiency of Pt NPs. Furthermore, the larger proportion of Pt 0 in the Pt/CNS-CR nanocomposite was more conducive to promoting the electron transfer, resulting in a higher hydrogen production rate of the Pt/CNS-CR nanocomposite than that of Pt/CNS-PR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Morphology and composition structures of the samples</head><p>XRD patterns of pure CNS, Pt/CNS-CR and Pt/CNS-PR nanocomposites are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="fig_0">1</ref>. The diffraction peaks at 13.1°a nd 27.6°are indexed to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) planes of g-C 3 N 4 , respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> After loading Pt NPs on the surface of CNS by either the photo-reduction or the chemical reduction method, only a new weak peak associated with the (1 1 1) plane of Pt NPs (JCPDS No. 04-0802) at 39.7°can be observed, owing to the low loading amount and the high dispersity of Pt NPs on the surface of CNS. While in the XRD pattern of the 2.0%-Pt/CNB-CR nanocomposite (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1A</ref> †), peaks for the (1 1 1) and (2 0 0) planes of Pt NPs can be observed clearly, due to the poor dispersion of Pt NPs on the surface of CNB, which leads to the larger sized Pt NPs being anchored on the surface of CNB (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1C</ref> and D †).</p><p>A SEM image of the as-synthesized CNB shows a thick block structure (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1B †)</ref>; after thermal oxidation exfoliation, the as-obtained CNS exhibit a 2D ultrathin sheet-like structure with a large amount of in-plane holes on the wrinkled surface, suggesting that CNS have a larger specific surface area and more active sites for the anchoring of Pt NPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">B</ref>). A TEM image (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR shows that Pt NPs with a mean size of ∼2.0 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2A</ref> †) are uniformly dispersed on the surface or in the pores of the CNS. The HRTEM image (inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>) indicates the presence of Pt NPs. The interplanar spacing of the nanoparticle is about 0.226 nm, which is consistent with the (111) plane of Pt. As the amount of Pt content increases from 1.0% to 2.5% in the Pt/CNS-CR nanocomposites (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> †), the loading number of Pt NPs on the surface of CNS increases, however, the average size of the Pt NPs does not change obviously. As for the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR nanocomposite (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref> and S2B †), the average size of Pt NPs is ∼1.8 nm, which is slightly smaller than that of the Pt/CNS-CR nanocomposite. However, Pt NPs are observed to be aggregated on the surface of CNB and the mean size is about 8.2 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1C</ref> and D †).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the as-prepared CNB, CNS and 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR samples. The specific surface area of pure CNB is only 10.89 m 2 g -1 , while the CNS sample possesses a large specific surface area of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="fig_0">1</ref> XRD patterns of the as-prepared CNS, Pt/CNS-CR and Pt/CNS-PR nanocomposites. 234.65 m 2 g -1 , which indicates that the ultrathin porous CNS might be an excellent catalyst support. After the loading of Pt NPs, the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR nanocomposite still displays a relatively large specific surface area of 172.01 m 2 g -1 . The high surface area provides more exposed active sites, thus ensuring an enhanced photocatalytic performance.</p><p>XPS photoelectron spectroscopy was used to investigate the surface elemental composition and chemical states of the asobtained nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">B</ref>, the C 1s spectra of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR and 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR show two main peaks at 284.7 eV and 288.6 eV, which are attributed to the graphitic carbon and N-CvN functional groups in the composites, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> The N 1s spectra of both 2.0%-Pt/ CNS-PR and 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR exhibit four peaks at 399.1, 400.2, 401.4 and 404.4 eV, which are associated with CvN-C functional groups, tertiary nitrogen (N(C) 3 ), N-H structure and π-excitations, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> Compared with the CNS, the peaks of C 1s and N 1s shift to the positions with higher binding energies after the deposition of Pt NPs. These shifts indicate an interaction between the Pt NPs and the CNS, owing to the polarization of electron density between the CNS support and the metal Pt. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> The strong metal-support interaction is beneficial for the electron transfer and the improved photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> and D display the XPS spectra of Pt 4f for the Pt loaded nanocomposites via the photo-reduction and the chemical reduction method, respectively. For 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR, the chemical states of Pt on the surface of CNS are Pt 0 , Pt 2+ and Pt 4+ . Correspondingly, Pt 2+ (73.58%) accounts for the largest proportion, while Pt 0 (7.55%) for the smallest. The existence of Pt 4+ might be due to the partly unreduced H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O. However, there are no peaks of Pt 4+ for 2.0%-Pt/ CNS-CR, indicating the complete reduction of H 2 PtCl 6 •6H 2 O during the process of chemical reduction. The main peaks of Pt 4f at 71.0 eV and 74.1 eV correspond to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 of metallic Pt 0 , respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The binding energies of 73.1 eV and 76.5 eV are attributed to Pt 4f 7/2 and Pt 4f 5/2 of Pt 2+ , respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> It can be seen that for 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR, the proportion of Pt 0 (62.03%) is larger than that of Pt 2+ (37.97%). These results suggest that the degree of reduction of metallic Pt 0 through different reduction methods is different. It has been reported that the metallic Pt 0 species as the active sites can trap electrons and facilitate H 2 evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Meanwhile, oxidized Pt 2+ plays an important role in inhibiting the undesirable hydrogen back-oxidation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> Thus it is anticipated that the Pt/CNS-CR photocatalyst with a larger proportion of Pt 0 might be more efficient than Pt/CNS-PR for hydrogen production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Optical and electrochemical properties</head><p>UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the CNS and Pt/CNS-CR samples are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Compared with the pure CNS, the onset absorption edges of the Pt/CNS-CR composites shift to a longer wavelength after the loading of Pt NPs on the surface of CNS. The light absorption intensities of the Pt/CNS-CR composites increase obviously, attributed to the plasma resonance effect of the Pt NPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>, the colour of CNS is light yellow, and the corresponding absorption band edge is around 450 nm. After the deposition of Pt NPs by photo-reduction and chemical reduction methods, the colour of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR and 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR  2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR and (D) 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR. becomes brown yellow and dark gray, respectively. The corresponding absorption edges of Pt/CNS-PR and Pt/CNS-CR are 460 nm and 486 nm, respectively. According to the plot of the Kubelka-Munk function versus the energy of exciting light (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>), the bandgaps of CNS, 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR and 2.0%-Pt/ CNS-CR are estimated to be 2.75, 2.69 and 2.55 eV, respectively. According to the Mott-Schottky plots (Fig. <ref type="figure">S4 †)</ref>, the flat band potentials of CNS, 2%-Pt/CNS-PR and 2%-Pt/CNS-CR are approximately -0.43 V (vs. NHE). As the Pt NPs are loaded on the surface of CNS, the CB potentials of the composites remain unchanged while the calculated VB potentials show an upward shift. The narrowed band gap and the increased intensity for the visible light absorption of the 2%-Pt/CNS-CR photocatalyst are beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic H 2 production.</p><p>In order to prove the positive role of metallic Pt in charge transport and separation, photoluminescence (PL) analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been carried out. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>, CNS display the highest fluorescence emission peak among the as-obtained samples, indicating the highest recombination rate of the photo-induced charges. Instead, the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR and 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR composites show a low fluorescence intensity, implying that the presence of the Pt co-catalyst effectively inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes. Moreover, 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR shows a lower peak intensity than 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR, attributed to the effect of the high content of Pt 0 on the inhibition of electron-hole pair recombination. EIS results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref> demonstrate that the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR composite shows the smallest radius of the arc, which suggests the smallest resistance of electron and hole transfer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Photocatalytic activities</head><p>The photocatalytic H 2 evolution activities of all the samples were investigated under visible light conditions (λ ≥ 420 nm) using TEOA as a hole sacrificial reagent. There is no H 2 evolution without the photocatalyst or light irradiation, indicating that H 2 is generated by the photocatalytic reactions. As displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8A</ref>, only a trace amount of H 2 production for the pure CNS can be observed, however, after the deposition of the Pt co-catalyst on the CNS, the H 2 production performance improves significantly. The photocatalytic activities of the Pt/ CNS-CR composites enhance with the increase of the loading contents of Pt, in which 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR shows the highest amount of H 2 generation of 15 725.0 µmol g -1 under visible light irradiation for 120 min. Furthermore, upon increasing the loading amount of Pt to 2.5%, the amount of H 2 generation decreases instead, because excessive Pt loading increases the height of Schottky barrier between the CNS and Pt interface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> Among the Pt/CNS-PR composites with different loading amounts of Pt, the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR composite shows the highest hydrogen evolution efficiency (Fig. <ref type="figure">S5A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B †</ref>). Nevertheless, it is still lower than those of all the Pt/CNS-CR composites. Notably, the 2.0%-Pt/CNB-CR composite shows the lowest amount of H 2 production among all the samples being tested. This indicates that the larger-sized Pt NPs on the surface of the CNB and the weaker electron transport ability between the CNB and Pt NPs lead to an unfavorable effect on the photocatalytic H 2 production. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8B</ref>, the H 2 evolution rate of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR is 7862.5 µmol g -1 h -1 , which is 6.92 times higher than that of the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR (1136.8 µmol g -1 h -1 ). As summarized in Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, † the hydrogen evolution rate of the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR photocatalyst in our work is much higher than those of noble metal modified   g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts in the literature observations. Moreover, the turnover-frequency (TOF) of the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR and 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR samples is calculated by the method of Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> The TOF of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR (1.60 wt% of Pt loading) is 692.121 h -1 , which is nine times higher than that of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-PR (1.90 wt% of Pt loading) with a TOF of 76.295 h -1 . The above results indicate that the chemical reduction is an effective method to achieve a high content of Pt 0 , promoting the interfacial electron transfer and increasing the utilization rate of Pt NPs. Furthermore, an effective contact between the metallic Pt 0 and CNS, an enhanced visible light harvesting and the synergistic effect between Pt 0 and Pt 2+ are all beneficial for improving the photocatalytic hydrogen production. After 10 cycling tests (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8C</ref>), the amount of hydrogen generated decreases slightly due to the agglomeration of Pt NPs during the photocatalytic process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6</ref> †). However, the amount of hydrogen generation still remains 14 643.5 µmol g -1 under visible light irradiation, indicating the good stability of the photocatalyst. In addition, the effect of different hole sacrificial agents on the photocatalytic hydrogen production of the 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR composite was also investigated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8D</ref>). Four different sacrificial agents of TEOA, lactic acid, methanol (MeOH) and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA 4-) were chosen for comparison. It is found that when using TEOA as the hole sacrificial agent the highest hydrogen evolution performance is achieved. This is due to faster hole scavenging resulting from a higher redox potential (-3.4 eV) of TEOA, accelerating the separation rate of electrons and holes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Photocatalytic mechanism of H 2 production</head><p>Based on the above experimental results, a possible mechanism for the visible light production of H 2 on the nanocomposite is proposed in Scheme <ref type="figure" target="fig_8">1</ref>. Under visible light irradiation, CNS can produce photo-generated electrons (e -) and holes (h + ) in the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), respectively. The electrons from the CB of CNS transfer to the surface of the Pt NPs quickly due to the excellent electronic conductivity of metal Pt 0 , leading to efficient electron-hole separation. Then, H + can accept the electrons from the Pt NPs to produce H 2 . At the same time, the holes in the valence band are consumed by the sacrificial agent of TEOA through the oxidation reaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion, ultrathin porous g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets have been prepared, which exhibit a large surface area and good electron transport ability. Then, as a co-catalyst, Pt NPs are successfully anchored on the surface of CNS by a chemical reduction method for efficient hydrogen production under visible light irradiation. Compared with the traditional photo-reduction method, the superior performance of 2.0%-Pt/CNS-CR is mainly attributed to the high content of metallic Pt 0 facilitating the electron transport and separation, Pt 2+ suppressing the undesirable hydrogen back-oxidation, and the intimate contact between the Pt NPs and the CNS. This work provides a new possibility for further improvement of the photocatalytic performances of g-C 3 N 4 -based photocatalysts, so as to exploit solar energy more efficiently.</p></div>
