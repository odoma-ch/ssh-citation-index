<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>There is considerable interest in wearable potentiometric ion sensors that can provide information about the quality of a person's health by monitoring ion concentration levels in biofluids. Significant progress has been achieved, particularly in device integration. However, the crucial interfacial water layer and the use of transducer materials remain challenging. Herein we report a paper-based, flexible, all-solid-state, ion-selective electrode (ISE) for the real-time analysis of sweat. The super-hydrophobic paper matrix was modified with a fluorinated alkyl silane to reduce the water-layer effect. We used a high-quality graphene suspension with high conductivity and capacitance as an ion-to-electron transducer, which further stabilized the potential. The integrated solid ISE has four channels that can detect K + , Na + , Cl -and pH simultaneously. This wearable potentiometric sensor has reliable accuracy, good potential stability and low detection limits, and could be used in healthcare and clinical analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Improper diet and high-intensity sports can cause changes in ion concentration levels, leading to physiological disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For instance, eating bananas on an empty stomach can result in a sudden increase in the level of potassium ions in the body, which might cause dizziness, vomiting and dyspnea. Ion-level abnormalities could also indicate diseases, such as hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which may result in damage to the heart, liver and kidneys <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Monitoring ion concentrations in the body is thus crucial to evaluating a person's health. Wearable sensors have exhibited the potential for non-invasive chemical/electrochemical analysis of biofluids, such as tears, saliva and sweat, for disease diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, drug detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and athletic performance optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>All-solid-state ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) are a type of electrochemical potentiometric sensor characterized by a solid junction, fast response, miniaturization and integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Unlike traditional liquid-junction electrodes, solid ISEs can be integrated into flexible, wearable devices for ion sensing. The key issue is potential stability. Other important factors are the hydrophobicity of the material (waterlayer effect) and the interfacial capacitance (electric double-layer and/ or redox capacitances) between the transducer and the ion-selective membrane (ISM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. A few carbon-based ion-to-electron transducer materials have been investigated, including ordered three-dimensional porous carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, carbon nanotubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and chemically reduced graphene oxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. One of the advantages of these carbon-based materials is that they can be readily dispersed in solvents to produce ink suspensions, which can then easily be transferred to various substrates. Andrade et al. reported a paper-based ISE using carbon nanotube ink as the transducer material <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This work proposed a new method for fabricating a low-cost ISE sensor platform. Qin and co-workers proposed flexible, three-dimensional, paper-based ISEs with carbon ink as the transducer material for potentiometric biosensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. This sensor detects biological analytes, including proteins and small molecules, rather than ions. This paper-based device is portable and flexible and so has potential applications in wearable sensors. Significant progress has been achieved in ex situ detection but real-time multi-ion analysis of biofluids remains a challenge.</p><p>In this work, we introduce a multichannel paper-based ISE for the real-time analysis of ions in human sweat. The paper-based substrate has previously demonstrated high levels of flexibility and conductivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, making it a good candidate for wearable electrochemical sensors. The hydrophobicity of the paper substrate was improved through modification with a fluorinated alkyl silane. A high-quality graphene suspension was sprayed onto the paper electrode as a high capacitance transducer with hydrophobic properties, which significantly reduces the water-layer effect. This high-quality graphene, directly exfoliated from graphite, has high conductivity and hydrophobicity compared with chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The resulting multichannel ISE can simultaneously detect Na + , K + , Cl -, and pH in sweat with reliable accuracy, good potential stability and low detection limits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Fabrication and characterization of the paper-based ISEs</head><p>The fabrication procedure for the ISEs is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The paper substrate was first chemically functionalized with C 10 F to make the surface super-hydrophobic in order to reduce the water-layer effect (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Then a 1 mL graphene suspension (5 mg/mL) was sprayed onto the modified paper at 80 °C using a mask (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). After functionalization, the water forms droplets on the surface and the contact angle is up to 147 o (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). The super-hydrophobic paper provides resistance to wetness in the test process, minimizes the air-water-solid interaction energy and makes the graphene suspension spread uniformly over the surface. Furthermore, the super-hydrophobic performance also avoids the external diffusion of the graphene cocktail solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the prepared ISE. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, there is a distinct boundary between the graphene electrode and the paper substrate. The graphene appears wrinkled with a high surface roughness, which greatly improves the capacitance of the electrode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>), which is beneficial to the potential stability. The thicknesses of the ion-selective membrane (ISM) and graphene electrode were determined as 950 μm and 114 μm, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">h</ref>).</p><p>The conductivity and flexibility of the prepared ISE were then examined (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). To confirm the quality of the graphene, Raman spectra were recorded and compared with those of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). The sp 2 carbon atoms breathing mode (D and G bands) were observed for both RGO and graphene. However, the D/G values for the RGO and graphene are 0.77 and 0.042, respectively, which demonstrates that there are many fewer defects in the high-quality graphene <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. The electrical resistance is a function of the number of spraying cycles on the modified paper (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). With just one layer the resistance is high but then significantly decreases upon further spraying. After five spraying cycles, the resistance reaches approximately 150 Ω.</p><p>The prepared ISE also has good mechanical flexibility (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>): it can be bent several times with only tiny changes in the resistance and electromotive force (EMF). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, after being bent by 30°, 60°, and 90°the EMF shows a maximum drift of 4 mV, with a drift in the resistance of 35 Ω. Furthermore, the resistance and the EMF remained almost unchanged after being repeatedly bent (30 times). These results indicate that the prepared ISE has good conductivity and flexibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Electrochemical characterization of the paper-based ISE</head><p>The performance of the prepared ISE was examined in a series of electrochemical tests. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the K + -GPE and K + -GCE was carried out in 0.1 M KCl (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). Both impedance spectra display high-frequency semicircles, which are related to the bulk resistance of the ISE membrane (R bulk ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. An equivalent circuit was designed to fit the experimental data (inset, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). The circuit is composed of a solution resistance (R s ), an interfacial constant phase element (CPE) in parallel with a bulk membrane resistance (R bulk ), and a classical Warburg diffusion element (Z w ). The value of R bulk decreased from 0.17 MΩ (K + -GCE) to 0.13 MΩ (K + -GPE), suggesting that the high-quality graphene serving as transducer enhances the ion-to-electron charge transfer. This effect is similar to the conducting polymer transducer (e.g., polypyrrole, PPY) reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, in which the PPY facilitated charge transport from the ISE membrane to the electrode.</p><p>Current reversal chronopotentiometry was carried out to estimate the capacitance and short-term potential stability of the prepared electrode (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). On applying a constant current of 1 nA to the K + -GCE and K + -GPE, the potential values of the electrodes were recorded, and the resistance calculated from the potential jump. Using the ratio ∆E/∆t, the potential drift of the K + -GCE is 5.73 × 10 -3 V/s and the K + -GPE is 3.3 × 10 -5 V/s. From the fundamental capacitor equation (I = C × ∆E∆t), the value of the electrical capacitance of the K + -GPE is 34.7 μF compared with 0.6 μF for K + -GCE, indicating that the K + -GPE has better potential stability.</p><p>Since a film of water at the interface between the ISM and electrode substrate significantly affects the potential stability, water-layer tests were carried out (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). The open circuit potentials (OCP) of the K + -GPE and K + -GCE were measured in 0.1 M KCl solution for 1 h; the electrodes were then moved into 0.1 M NaCl solution for 2 h, and finally returned to the 0.1 M KCl solution for several hours. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>, the K + -GCE maintains its initial potential but shows continuous drift. However, the potential of K + -GPE is stable throughout the test. The super-hydrophobic property of the K + -GPE stops the formation of a water layer, leading to high potential stability. This was further demonstrated by a long-term study of potential drift which showed a small positive drift of 0.18 mV/h over a test period of 12 h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Potentiometric performances</head><p>The potential responses of the prepared ISE electrodes were measured in aqueous solutions containing the cations and anions of interest in concentrations from 10 -7 M to 1 M (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The potentiometric time traces and calibration curves of the K + -GCE, K + -GPE, Na + -GPE, Cl --GPE and H + -GPE are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a-e</ref>. We first examined the potential response of the K + -GCE to provide a basis for comparison. The slope was determined to be 49.4 ± 0.58 mV/decade (R 2 = 0.9952) and the linear range from 10 -1 M to 10 -5 M (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>). The slope is less than the Nernst response since there is no transducer layer, resulting in potential drift at low concentrations of K + . If the linear range is reduced to 10 -1 M to 10 -4 M, the slope increases to 52.0 ± 0.53 mV/ decade (R 2 = 0.9990). For the K + -GPE, the response slope is 57.0 ± 0.25 mV/decade (R 2 = 0.9994) with a linear range from 10 -1 M to 10 -6 M (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>), illustrating the benefits of the graphene transducer. Since there are multiple ions in sweat, Na + and Cl -were also tested, giving Nernstian slopes of 55.7 ± 0.08 mV/decade and 56.7 ± 0.28 mV/decade, respectively. The linear range is from 10 -1 M to 10 -6 M, which is suitable for detection in sweat. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref> illustrates the potential response time trace of the H + -GPE in solution with pH values from 4 to 7.5, which also shows a Nernstian response (56 ± 0.58 mV/decade).</p><p>There are many complex components in sweat which might affect the response. To mimic the sweat environment, an anti-interference test was performed by adding certain concentrations of CaCl 2 , HCl, glucose and AA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>). No apparent potential drift was observed. Overall, the above results demonstrate that the graphene-based ISE has high sensitivity and selectivity, a wide linear range and good potential stability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Monitoring ions in sweat</head><p>To monitor the ions present in sweat, we recruited a volunteer who exercised for 1 h. The sensor was connected to a conductor which on the other side was connected to the Labview system, with multichannel data being transferred instantaneously, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>. The realtime data corresponding to the amounts of K + , Na + , Cl -present and the pH of the sweat are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>. The signals are stable. The concentrations of target ions were measured as follows: K + (≈6.5 mM), Na + (≈49.5 mM), Cl -(≈61.4 mM) and pH (≈6.91). For comparison, the sweat was collected by centrifuging and analyzed by ICP-MS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>). The accuracy of the real-time ISE detection was calculated to be K + (90%), Na + (88.4%), Cl -(87.6%) and pH (88.7%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>We fabricated a multichannel, wearable ISE sensor for the real-time detection of multiple ions in human sweat. The sensor exhibits good potential stability, has low detection limits and a wide linear range by virtue of the super-hydrophobic paper substrate and high-quality graphene transducer. Multiple channels have been designed to simultaneously detect K + , Na + Cl -and pH with reliable accuracy. This ISE sensor system could be further improved, for example by constructing a micro-or nano-scale skin-fit sensor chip that tests more ions simultaneously. It could also be integrated with a self-powered unit and combined with mobile devices for in situ analysis in healthcare and clinical research. </p></div>
