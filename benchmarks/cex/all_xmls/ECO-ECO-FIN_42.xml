<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Over the last twenty five years, behavioral financial economists have provided mounting evidence of suboptimal behavior among investors (e.g. excess trading, over-confidence, anchoring, framing, conservatism, herding behavior, under-diversification etc.).<ref type="footnote" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> At the same time, the theory of continuous-time optimal portfolio choice initiated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Merton (1971)</ref> has been extended to deal with ever more general preferences <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> and models of asset returns, <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> producing analytical solutions that facilitate the task of computing (either closed-form, or nearly) optimal portfolio rules. <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> In this paper, we propose a representation of suboptimal investment behavior that is based on the SDF paradigm, and develop a novel Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach to compute the welfare costs due to suboptimal investment behavior. Our representation is based on the notion that suboptimal investment behavior can be rationalized as being the investor’s optimal decision under the wrong SDF, while wealth trajectories and budget constraints are based on the true SDF, hence generating a welfare loss. We apply this simple idea to assess the welfare cost of suboptimal investment rules.</p><p>We study the quantitative implications of suboptimal portfolio choice under standard constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) preferences, using two different financial market models: the stochastic volatility model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Liu and Pan (2003)</ref>, and the time-varying bond risk premia model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koijen et al. (2010)</ref>. In both cases, our MC simulation approach delivers comparable welfare losses to those computed in the original studies, both of which are based on partial differential equations (PDE) and - finite-difference schemes.</p><p>Our paper adds to the literature on two fronts. First, it proposes a way to rationalize suboptimal investment decisions using the SDF paradigm. If we have observable portfolio allocations, this relationship helps estimating a functional form of the SDF. <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> Second, it proposes a MC simulation approach based on the martingale approach to portfolio problems (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Cox and Huang, 1989</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Karatzas et al., 1987</ref>. Recent applications can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Castañeda and Devoto, 2016</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Lim et al., 2017)</ref>. Specifically, we use the well-known relationship between the SDF and the optimal policies that determine the investor’s utility (e.g. consumption, terminal wealth etc.), to compute the welfare cost produced by solving the investment problem under both the true and the wrong SDF.<ref type="footnote" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref></p><p>Our paper is related to several strands of the literature.

The expressions above naturally call for Monte Carlo simulations as the numerical method of choice. In particular, we can estimate the CEQ loss by computing independent copies of the expression inside the expectation, and then taking the average of all of these.

All that is needed is a representation of the optimal payoffs (i.e. X_T^* and X_T^{**}) as computable functions of the "adjusted" SDF (resp., ξη and ξ̃η̃). Two important cases that cannot be accommodated within the outlined framework are the cases of (Epstein-Zin) Stochastic Differential Utility (SDU) preferences, and jumps processes generated by an infinite activity process (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Jin and Zhang (2012)</ref>).

In particular, it considers a simplified version (i.e. without jumps) of the model studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Liu and Pan (2003)</ref> (hereafter LP), in a complete market with two sources of Brownian motion uncertainty (i.e. W ∈ ℝ^2), a constant interest rate (IR) and two risky assets: a stock index, and an option contract.</p><p>In this case, the stock index satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">dS_t/S_t = (r + θ_{S,t}√V_t)dt + √V_t dW_{S,t}, S_0 given<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where θ_{S,t} is MPR of equity risk, and V_t follows a (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Heston, 1993</ref>) dynamics, dV_t = κ(V̄ - V_t)dt + η√V_t(ρdW_{S,t} + √(1-ρ^2)dW_{V,t}), V_0 given, where (κ, η, ρ) are constant parameters, ρ ∈ [-1,1] is the (instantaneous) correlation between dS/S and dV, and W = (W_S, W_V)′ are two independent BMP.</p><p>The price of the option contract can be written as O_t = g(S_t,V_t), for some function g. An application of Ito's Lemma delivers dO_t = (rO_t + θ_{S,t}σ_{OS,t} + θ_{O,t}σ_{OV,t})dt + σ_{OS,t}dW_{S,t} + σ_{OV,t}dW_{V,t}, where σ_{OS,t} = √V_t[g_SS_t + g_Vηρ], σ_{OV,t} = √V_tg_Vη(1-ρ^2)^{1/2}, with g_S = ∂_Sg, g_V = ∂_Vg, and θ_{O,t} as the MPR of volatility risk. Following Liu and Pan, we set θ_{S,t} = θ_S√V_t, and θ_{O,t} = θ_O√V_t, where (θ_S, θ_O) are two constant parameters.</p><p>The true dynamic of V_t is not observable, but we assume that it could be inferred with the data available in the market. We consider the case where the welfare cost is due to a wrong inference made on V_t. Specifically, we assume that the unsophisticated investor believes V_t to follow a time-varying deterministic GARCH(1,1) process (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Corradi, 2000)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_15">dV_t = (ω_0 + ω_1V_t)dt, V_0 given<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where (ω_0, ω_1) are constant parameters. Just like in LP, there are no portfolio constraints, that is π_t = (π_{S,t},π_{O,t}) ∈ 𝒦 = ℝ^2, which renders η_T = η̃_T = 1. The wrong inference on the volatility leads the unsophisticated investor to believe that the option contract is redundant in the portfolio choice problem. The unsophisticated investor dismisses the option contract, and hence the SDF used satisfies dξ̃_t/ξ̃_t = -rdt - θ_{S,t}dW_{S,t}, instead of the true SDF that satisfies dξ_t/ξ_t = -rdt - θ_{S,t}dW_{S,t} - θ_{O,t}dW_{V,t}<ref type="footnote" target="#foot_8">foot_8</ref>. In this way we can compute the CEQ loss using the expressions in (<ref type="formula" target="formula_12">13</ref>) and (<ref type="formula" target="formula_13">14</ref>), by simulating trajectories of ξ_T and ξ̃_T, respectively.</p><p>To validate our simulation approach for estimating the welfare cost, we replicate the sensitivity analysis done by LP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The loss estimated in LP derives from a strategy that does not use the derivative contract and a strategy that does, which equals the difference between using the true and wrong SDF in our exercise. Results are consistent. The CEQ loss amounts to nearly 30% of initial wealth in the basecase. As explained in LP, the demand for the option contract is driven mostly by the myopic component. That's why the loss is larger when θ_O deviates from zero and when risk aversion is smaller. The demand for the option contract increases and thus premium earnings on volatility risk. Similar to LP, the loss increases when both the initial volatility (V_0) and the stochastic component of the volatility (η) increase, because the hedging demand for the option contract increases too. The same happens when we increase the investment horizon. Fig. C.2 in Appendix C shows these same results but in terms of a management fee (explained latter in Exercise 2) and not the CEQ loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Missing intertemporal hedging demand</head><p>The second exercise explores the effects of not accounting for the intertemporal hedging demand, when the nominal interest rates (IR) process is stochastic. In particular, it considers the complete market version of the model studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Koijen et al. (2010)</ref> (hereafter KNW), with 4 and four (instead of three) risky assets: two zero-coupon nominal bonds, an (added) inflation-linked security, and a stock index.</p>
<p>The KNW model contains a 2-dimensional state variable vector, Y_t = (Y_{1,t}, Y_{2,t})′ ∈ ℝ^2, which evolves according to</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">\begin{pmatrix} dY_{1,t} \\ dY_{2,t} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} κ_{11} &amp; κ_{12} \\ κ_{21} &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} Y_{1,t} \\ Y_{2,t} \end{pmatrix} dt + \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} dW_{1,t} \\ dW_{2,t} \\ dW_{3,t} \\ dW_{4,t} \end{pmatrix}<label>(17)</label></formula><p>(Y_{1,0}, Y_{2,0}) given, where (κ_{11}, κ_{12}, κ_{21}) are constant coefficients. The nominal IR (r_t), is an affine affine function of Y_t satisfying r_t = β_{r0} + β_{r1}Y_t ∈ ℝ, where β_{r0} is a constant coefficient, and β_{r1}′ ∈ ℝ^2 contains constant parameters. The prices of the risky assets evolve according to the following system  \begin{cases} dB_t^{T_j}/B_t^{T_j} = (r_t + σ_{B_j,t}θ_t) dt + σ_{B_j,t}dW_t, B_0^{T_j} given, \\dS_{Π,t}/S_{Π,t} = (r_t + σ_{Π,t}θ_t)dt + σ_{S_{Π,t}}dW_t, S_{Π,0} given, \\dS_t/S_t = (r_t + σ_Sθ_t)dt + σ_S dW_t, S_0 given,\end{cases} where B_t^{T_j} = 𝔼_t[ξ_{t,T_j}] is the (arbitrage-free) price of a nominal zero-coupon bond with maturity T_j, with 0 &lt; T_1 &lt; T_2 = T and ξ_{t,T_j} ≡ ξ_{T_j}/ξ_t as the conditional SDF, σ_{B_j,t}′ ∈ ℝ^4. S_{Π,t} is the price of an inflation-linked security. Π_t is the price index with S_{Π,t} = 𝔼_t[ξ_{t,T}Π_T] and σ_{S_{Π,t}}′ ∈ ℝ^4, S_t is the price of the stock-index, and σ_S′ ∈ ℝ^4. We assume the volatility matrix, σ_t = (σ_{B_1,t}, σ_{B_2,t}, σ_{S_{Π,t}}, σ_S), to be invertible. In addition, KNW impose the MPR as affine in the state variables, that is to say, θ_t = θ_0 + θ_1Y_t ∈ ℝ^4, with θ_1 ∈ ℝ^{4×2}. Details on the calibration, which is based on KNW estimations, is given in Appendix A.</p><p>We consider the case where the welfare loss is due to the unsophisticated investor mistakenly assessing the time-varying nature of the investment opportunity set. Specifically, we assume that he/she wrongly perceives the nominal bond risk premia to be constant (i.e. σ_{B_j,t}θ_t ≡ x_{B_j}, for j = 1,2), where they are in fact stochastic (i.e. time-varying functions of Y_t)<ref type="footnote" target="#foot_9">foot_9</ref>. We also assume the unsophisticated investor ignores the variation in the term structure of interest rates.</p><p>Admissible portfolio rules are subject to standard no short-sales and no borrowing constraints. To emulate the results from KNW, we add the restriction that the demand of the inflation linked security equals zero at all times. The set 𝒦 is therefore given by 𝒦 = {π_t ∈ ℝ^4 : π_{t,i} ≥ 0, ∀ i, π_t*1 ≤ 1, π_{3,t} = 0}</p><p>The adjustment factor η_T for set 𝒦 is not known. Therefore, we simulate independent copies for the wealth X_t^* and X_t^{**} and determine the CEQ loss using Eqs. (<ref type="formula" target="formula_10">11</ref>) and (<ref type="formula" target="formula_11">12</ref>). To do this, we first compute the unconstrained version of the optimal and sub-optimal portfolio rules, π_t^{*u} and π_t^{**u} respectively; and then compute nearly optimal constrained portfolio rules from the latter.</p><p>From optimality conditions, it is easy to see that unconstrained optimal allocation satisfies</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">π_t^{*u} = (γσ_t′)^{-1}θ_t + (σ_t′)^{-1}\left\{∑_{j=1}^2 σ_{Y_j}′ \frac{∂_{Y_j}a^u(t,Y_{1,t},Y_{2,t})}{a^u(t,Y_{1,t},Y_{2,t})}\right\}<label>(18)</label></formula><p>where a^u(t,Y_{1,t},Y_{2,t}) = 𝔼_t[ξ_{t,T}^ρ]. This is the optimal unconstrained portfolio rule (i.e. when 𝒦 = ℝ^4) decomposed into its myopic and hedging demand terms. To compute the hedging demand we use the Monte Carlo with Malliavin Derivative (MCMD) method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Detemple et al. (2003)</ref>. The details of this computation can be found in Appendix B.</p><p>The unconstrained allocation of the unsophisticated investor does not include the hedging demand, since the nominal bond risk premium and term structure does not depend on states Y_1 and Y_2. Therefore, we have</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">π_t^{**u} = (γσ_t′)^{-1}θ_0<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Appendix A shows the details in how to derive Eqs. (<ref type="formula" target="formula_17">18</ref>) and (<ref type="formula" target="formula_18">19</ref>). We define the nearly optimal portfolio policy for the constrained problem as (with x^+ ≡ max(x,0))</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">π^* = \begin{cases}π_3^* = 0 \text{ and } π_{i,t}^* = (π_t^{*u})_i^+, &amp; \text{if } b^u ≡ ∑_{i≠3} (π_t^{*u})_i^+ ≤ 1, \\π_3^* = 0 \text{ and } π_{i,t}^* = (π_t^{*u})_i^+/b^u, &amp; \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}<label>(20)</label></formula><p>The constrained policy for the unsophisticated investor π^{**} is computed similarly, under the same rule in (<ref type="formula" target="formula_19">20</ref>) and using π_t^{**u}. The outlined procedure allows us to simulate independent copies of X_T^* and X_T^{**}, using (<ref type="formula" target="formula_0">1</ref>) and the investment policies π^* and π^{**} respectively.</p><p>KNW estimate the loss of a life-cycle investor, when it conditions its decisions on wealth and age only and without considering the time-varying bond risk premia or the variation in the term structure of interest rates. Thus, this loss is comparable to the loss between π^* and π^{**}. Table <ref type="table" target="tab_0">1</ref> depicts the CEQ loss estimates, using the estimated coefficients in KNW. We also compute the welfare loss in terms of the same metric used by KNW, which is the maximum management fee (F) that can be charged when investing with the "correct" model (i.e. the true data generating process, or DGP) to end up with the same expected utility level as with the suboptimal strategy. The relationship between L_0 and F is given by (see further details in Appendix C)</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">F = -\frac{1}{T} log(1 - L_0)<label>(21)</label></formula><p>Naturally, a greater welfare loss implies higher fees. Our results are consistent with the ones obtained by KNW. Fees are similar when we change the investment horizon, and loss magnitudes are close to 100 basis points (bp) for γ = 5 (value used by KNW). As expected, the loss measured in terms of fees is slightly lower when the investor is more risk averse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and further extensions</head><p>This paper proposes a way of rationalizing suboptimal investment behavior, based on the SDF paradigm. The proposed methorenders Monte Carlo simulation as the numerical method of choice to compute the welfare loss due to suboptimality. The proposed method can be applied whenever the optimal payoffs can be represented as computable functions of the "adjusted" (due to convex portfolio constraints) SDF.</p><p>We carry out two numerical exercises to illustrate the application of the method. One with a missing asset class (options), and a second one unsophisticated investor wrongly assumes the investment opportunity set to be constant. In both cases, we show that welfare cost due to suboptimality can be relatively high. These findings go somewhat against recent studies showing that the hedging component of optimal investment rules are of lesser importance (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Diris et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lan, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Our representation of suboptimal investment behavior can also be used to assess model risk. In particular, a model risk could be conducted by using as the wrong SDF, the one that omits an important state variable, or misses a relevant source of risk (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Branger et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Branger and Hansis, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Branger and Larsen, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kallsen and Muhle-Karbe, 2015)</ref>. This representation could possibly allow the employment of the wrong SDF in misspecified models (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rubtsov, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Jang et al., 2016)</ref> and estimate the losses with respect to a model without any misspecification.</p></div>

    <p>As shown by KNW, when rₜ is affine in Yₜ then Bₜᵀ = exp(nᵀ(xₜ) + mᵀ(xₜ)′Yₜ), with nᵀ(xₜ) and mᵀ(xₜ) as deterministic functions of time-to-maturity, T = T − t. Therefore, the nominal bond volatility can be written as σᴮₜᵀ = hᵀ(t)σʸₜ + bᵀ(t)σᴠʸₜ, where hᵀ(t) and bᵀ(t) are deterministic functions of T − t. Nominal bond risk premia, πᴮₜᵀ = σᴮₜᵀλₜ, are therefore time-varying functions of Yₜ.</p>
