<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest dated materials that provide crucial information about the isotopic reservoirs present in the early Solar System. For a variety of elements, CAIs have isotope compositions that are uniform yet distinct from later formed solid material. However, despite being the most abundant metal in the Solar System, the isotopic composition of Fe in CAIs is not well constrained. In an attempt to determine the Fe isotopic compositions of CAIs, we combine extensive work from a previously studied CAI sample set with new isotopic work characterizing mass-dependent and mass-independent (nucleosynthetic) signatures in Mg, Ca, and Fe. This investigation includes work on three mineral separates of the Allende CAI Egg 2. For all isotope systems investigated, we find that in general, fine-grained CAIs exhibit light mass-dependent isotopic signatures relative to terrestrial standards, whereas igneous CAIs have heavier isotopic compositions relative to the fine-grained CAIs. Importantly, the mass-dependent Fe isotope signatures of bulk CAIs show a range of both light (fine-grained CAIs) and heavy (igneous CAIs) isotopic signatures relative to bulk chondrites, suggesting that Fe isotope signatures in CAIs largely derive from mass fractionation events such as condensation and evaporation occurring in the nebula. Such signatures show that a significant portion of the secondary alteration experienced by CAIs, particularly prevalent in fine-grained inclusions, occurred in the nebula prior to accretion into their respective parent bodies.</p><p>Regarding nucleosynthetic Fe isotope signatures, we do not observe any variation outside of analytical uncertainty in bulk CAIs compared to terrestrial standards. In contrast, all three Egg 2 mineral separates display resolved mass-independent excesses in 56 Fe compared to terrestrial standards. Furthermore, we find that the combined mass-dependent and nucleosynthetic Fe isotopic compositions of the Egg 2 mineral separates are well correlated, likely indicating that Fe indigenous to the CAI is mixed with less anomalous Fe, presumably from the solar nebula. Thus, these reported nucleosynthetic anomalies may point in the direction of the original Fe isotope composition of the CAI-forming region, but they likely only provide a minimum isotopic difference between the original mass-independent Fe isotopic composition of CAIs and that of later formed solids.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Marking the start of our Solar System, calciumaluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest dated solids that formed at about 4.567 Ga <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amelin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bouvier et al., 2011a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Connelly et al., 2012)</ref>. Therefore, CAIs provide insightful information about the starting materials and processing of the earliest reservoir(s) in the Solar System. For example, the petrology and chemical make-up of a CAI may reveal the formation conditions and subsequent processes that acted on that sample, whereas the isotopic composition of a CAI can identify its original starting material and subsequent mixing with other reservoirs. The natural isotope variations of CAIs may reflect massindependent processes which include (1) radiogenic ingrowth, (2) nuclear transmutations caused by irradiation, or (3) nucleosynthetic anomalies arising from the incomplete homogenization of presolar material. In contrast, mass-dependent isotope variations record physicochemical processes such as evaporation or condensation, or in some cases, isotopic fractionation caused by redox transitions. Importantly, it has been well-documented that CAIs have both mass-dependent and mass-independent (nucleosynthetic) isotopic anomalies relative to later formed solids such as chondrules, chondrites, and terrestrial planets (see review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Dauphas and Schauble, 2016</ref>, and references therein). The most isotopically distinct subgroups of CAIs are the hibonite-rich inclusions (distinguished mineralogically as platy hibonite crystals (PLACs) and spinel-hibonite inclusions (SHIBs)) and the rare FUN (Fractionation and Unknown Nuclear effects) inclusions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Krot et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kööp et al., 2016)</ref>. The FUN CAIs in particular display the largest mass-dependent effects as well as large nucleosynthetic anomalies. However, this study focuses on CAIs from CV3 and CK3 chondrites (hereafter referred to simply as CAIs) that typically display smaller mass-dependent isotope fractionations and isotope anomalies than FUN CAIs.</p><p>Many prior studies of CAIs focusing on nucleosynthetic isotopic variations have targeted elements in and around the Fe-peak of nucleosynthesis such as Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, and Zn (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Clayton and Mayeda, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Wasserburg et al., 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Niederer et al., 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Niederer et al., , 1981</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Niederer et al., , 1985;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Niemeyer and Lugmair, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Heydegger et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Niederer and Papanastassiou, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Birck and Allègre, 1984,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Birck and Lugmair, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Papanastassiou and Brigham, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Loss and Lugmair, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Quitté et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Leya et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Trinquier et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Williams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Simon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Davis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bermingham et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al., 2018)</ref>. In general, these studies report that CAIs have nucleosynthetic signatures for these elements that are distinct from terrestrial compositions, and they typically have the largest anomaly in the most neutron-rich isotopes of these elements (i.e., 48 Ca, 50 Ti, 54 Cr, 64 Ni). Correlations in isotopes of different elements in and around the Fe-peak (i.e., Sc to Ge) can help to identify nucleosynthetic sources that contributed to the solar nebula and can, thus, aid in understanding the late evolution of stars. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nittler et al. (2018)</ref> reported correlated 54 Cr and 50 Ti anomalies in presolar oxide grains, suggesting that these grains likely formed in Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) or electron-capture supernovae. Therefore, if nucleosynthetic correlations such as these are present in CAIs, this may aid in understanding why the reservoir from which CAIs formed was isotopically distinct. However, while many elements in and around the Fe-peak have been studied comprehensively, the Fe isotopic composition of CAIs has not been investigated extensively to date.</p><p>Iron is an interesting element for isotopic investigation because it has four stable isotopes, 54 Fe (5.845%), 56 Fe (91.754%), 57 Fe (2.119%), and 58 Fe (0.282%) that are produced by nuclear statistical equilibrium, also called the e-process of nucleosynthesis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hainebach et al., 1974)</ref>. Depending on the type of stellar environment (e.g., its mass, neutron density, or location within the stellar source), these isotopes can be expected to be over-or under-produced relative to terrestrial isotope abundances. However, despite being the most abundant metal in the Solar System, the isotopic composition of Fe in CAIs is not well constrained as only one study to date has investigated the massindependent Fe isotope compositions of CAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Völkening and Papanastassiou, 1989)</ref>. They reported Fe isotope variability in two FUN CAIs and in addition, they reported that the Allende CAI Egg 2 is characterized by a small deficit in 57 Fe and a large excess in the neutron-rich isotope 58 Fe. However, the same study also measured three other non-FUN CAI samples which did not have resolved excesses in 58 Fe, suggesting that Egg 2 may be a unique sample.</p><p>Compared to elements in CAIs like Al and Ca, Fe is not predicted to be a major constituent of CAIs due to its lower condensation temperature and the highly reduced conditions of CAI formation. However, Fe can replace other elements (i.e., Mg, Ca) during secondary alteration. For example, it is well-documented in CAIs that MgO is replaced by FeO and ZnO within spinel during secondary alteration (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Rout and Bischoff, 2008)</ref>. Furthermore, perovskite, a typical mineral found in CAIs, can be fully or partially converted to ilmenite during secondary alteration resulting from FeO replacing CaO (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bischoff and Keil, 1984)</ref>. With such potential for pervasive Fe replacement, obtaining a robust pre-alteration isotopic signature of Fe in CAIs is not straightforward. Therefore, in this work we attempt to decipher the original Fe isotopic composition of the CAI-forming region by examining the Fe isotopic compositions in a large, well-characterized CAI sample set along with separated mineral phases from the Egg 2 CAI.</p><p>In contrast to nucleosynthetic effects-which probe the original building material of CAIs-multiple studies have investigated the mass-dependent Mg, Ca, Ti, and Ni isotopic signatures in CAIs. This is done to understand the processes involved in CAI formation such as evaporation and condensation or isotopic exchange with later formed solids (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Lee et al., 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Niederer and Papanastassiou, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bizzarro et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Schiller et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schiller et al., , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amsellem et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Davis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Simon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bermingham et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al., 2018)</ref>. Although the Fe mass-dependent signatures of CAIs could indicate their condensation/evaporation histories, only two studies have examined massdependent Fe isotopic compositions in CAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mullane et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hezel et al., 2008)</ref>. These studies found that most CAIs measured were isotopically light in their Fe composition compared to bulk chondrite and terrestrial values; however, the interpretation of these signatures is not straightforward, as Fe is susceptible to secondary alteration in CAIs. Thus, the mass-dependent Fe isotope compositions of CAIs remains poorly constrained.</p><p>This study seeks to investigate the original Fe isotopic composition of the CAI-forming region by examining the mass-dependent and nucleosynthetic isotopic signatures of a variety of elements (i.e., Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Sr, U) using a well-studied CAI sample set <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Burkhardt et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brennecka et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kruijer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shollenberger et al., 2018a)</ref>. This sample set includes CAIs with large excesses in the most neutron-rich isotopes of Ti, Cr, and Ni <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mercer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Brennecka et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al., 2018)</ref>. Additionally, we revisit the Allende CAI Egg 2, the sample with the reported large mass-independent excess in 58 Fe <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Völkening and Papanastassiou, 1989)</ref>, by investigating three mineral separates from the same sample, which may aid in separating and distinguishing between the primary and secondary Fe hosted in this inclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SAMPLES AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Samples investigated</head><p>The samples selected for this study were previously digested CAIs that have mass-dependent and nucleosynthetic anomalies in many other elements such as Ti, Cr, Ni, Zr, Sr, Mo, Ba, Nd, Sm, Er, Yb, Hf, and U (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burkhardt et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brennecka et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kruijer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shollenberger et al., 2018a,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al., 2018)</ref> along with three mineral separates from an aliquot of the Egg 2 CAI provided by the late G. J. Wasserburg. The mineral separation of Egg 2, a type B CAI from the Allende CV3.6 chondrite, was done at the California Institute of Technology mainly by heavy liquid separation (methylene iodide and acetone) followed by magnetic susceptibility separation. The separated phases were divided into three groups, namely 3.3 g/mL sink -magnetic (89 mg), 3.3 g/mL sink -less magnetic (38 mg), and 3.1 g/mL float (55 mg), which broadly represent high-Fe pyroxene (high-Fe Px), high-Mg pyroxene (high-Mg Px), and plagioclase (Plag) separates, respectively. Following transfer to Arizona State University (ASU), the separates of Egg 2 were exposed to a combination of concentrated HF, HNO 3 , and HCl to achieve total sample dissolution. A bulk sample of Egg 2 was not available for this work.</p><p>Detailed sample information about the bulk CAIs can be found in the aforementioned studies, but a brief overview of all the samples is given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. This sample set of 26 bulk CAIs includes multiple petrologic types of CAIs (A, B, and C) and samples that have experienced different thermal histories, as evidenced by their varied rare earth element (REE) patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns of the mineral separates from the Egg 2 type B Allende CAI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) are relatively unfractionated. The Egg 2 pyroxene separates have light rare earth element (LREE) depletions and negative Eu anomalies characteristic of this phase, while the Egg 2 plagioclase has a slight LREE enrichment and positive Eu anomaly that is typical for this mineral. A calculated bulk Egg 2 REE pattern is also flat with a negative Eu anomaly, consistent with a group I/III pattern. For consistency, throughout this work the term igneous is used to describe relatively coarse-grained CAIs of the type A, B, or C, whereas the remaining CAIs are designated as finegrained, which includes an altered type A inclusion and a fluffy type A inclusion (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The terrestrial rock standards BCR-2 and BHVO-2 along with an aliquot of bulk Allende were also included in this study to verify analytical procedures. Note that all systems previously investigated for each sample are given below in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Trace element measurements</head><p>Sample solution aliquots, prior to any chemical separations, were measured for trace element abundances and reported in previous studies (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) for most of the bulk CAIs in this work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brennecka et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kruijer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Shollenberger et al., 2018a)</ref>. The details of trace element measurements for CAIs from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Burkhardt et al. (2008)</ref> are found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Burkhardt et al. (2012)</ref>. For the Egg 2 separates, an aliquot ($1%) of each initial sample dissolution was reserved for trace element analyses by quadrupole ICPMS (Thermo Scientific Ò XSERIES) at ASU (REE patterns provided in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). All REE data from samples utilized in this study are given in the electronic annex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Chemical separation and isotope measurements of Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Sr, and U</head><p>Presented below are the chemical separation procedures and mass spectrometry methods used to isolate, purify, and measure all elements investigated in this study. Sample solution aliquots for each element were taken from minimally processed materials (see electronic annex for concerns regarding previous chemical procedures). All chemical reagents used in this study were standard clean lab acids (e.g., Merck Millipore Emsure TM grade acids (69% HNO 3 , 37% HCl, 48% HF) that had been distilled twice with Savillex TM DST-1000 Acid Purification Systems) and were diluted appropriately with 18.2 MX* cm H 2 O (Millipore Milli-Q Ò , hereafter "MQ"). Throughout this study, all mass-dependent variations are presented in d-notation, or deviation from the terrestrial standard in parts per thousand using the following equation where E is the element of interest (e.g., Fe), i is the isotope of interest (e.g., 56 Fe), and j is the reference isotope (e.g., 54 Fe):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">di=j Esample ¼ DC3 ð i E= j EÞsample ETX 1 EOT 1000 ð i E= j EÞstandard</formula><p>In contrast, after correction for mass-dependent effects all nucleosynthetic variations are shown in e-notation, or mass-independent deviations from the terrestrial standard in parts per ten thousand using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">e i X sample ¼ i X = j X ð Þ sample i X = j X ð Þ standard À 1 Â 10; 000</formula><p>In this equation, X is the element of interest (e.g., Fe), i is the isotope of interest (e.g., 58 Fe), and j is the isotope in the denominator of the internal normalization ratio (e.g., 54 Fe). Furthermore, the nucleosynthetic variations are determined by internally normalizing to a fixed isotope ratio using the exponential law to cancel out instrumental mass bias and natural stable isotope fractionation (see details for each element below). The reported uncertainties represent the 2Â standard deviation (2SD) of replicate sample analyses or the long-term reproducibility of the terrestrial standard (i.e., 2SD of repeat analyses of the terrestrial standard) during the measurement campaign.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Magnesium</head><p>Chemical separation of Mg took place in the Isotope Cosmochemistry and Geochronology Laboratory (ICGL) at ASU using procedures adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Spivak-Birndorf et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bouvier et al. (2011b)</ref>. Approximately 5% of each dissolved CAI sample (equivalent to $6-16 lg Mg) was passed through a cation-exchange column packed with AG50x8 200-400 mesh resin, and Mg was eluted in 1 N HNO 3 . This column procedure was repeated three times for each sample to ensure complete separation of Mg from Al, Ca, and other cations (i.e., Fe, Na), and resulted in recovery of &gt;98% of the Mg for each sample. Magnesium isotopic analysis was performed on the Thermo Scientific Ò Neptune MC-ICPMS housed in the ICGL at ASU. The purified Mg samples, diluted to 250 ppb Mg in 3% HNO 3 , were introduced into the mass spectrometer with a flow rate of 100 lL/min using an ESI APEX Ò desolvating nebulizer system achieving a beam intensity of $22-25 V on 24 Mg. The mass spectrometer was operated in medium resolution mode in order to separate molecular interferences of 12 C 2 + , 12 C 14 N + , and 24 MgH + . The instrumental mass bias was corrected using the sample-standard bracketing method, using the Mg isotopic standard DSM-3. An individual measurement consisted of 20 cycles utilizing 8 s integration times, and samples were measured three times each. The external reproducibility (2SD) in this work was ±0.07 for d 25/24 Mg and ±0.11 for d 26/24 Mg.</p></div>

Sample dissolution aliquots corresponding to approximately 100 mg Fe were obtained for each CAI and mineral separate. Iron was separated from the sample matrix using $1.8 mL AG1-X8 (100-200 mesh) anion-exchange resin following the procedure from <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Schuth et al. (2015)</ref>. Briefly, the resin was cleaned with MQ H 2 O, 3 N HNO 3 , 0.4 N HCl, and 7 N HCl. Samples were loaded in 7 N HCl, and the columns were rinsed with 7 N HCl to remove the matrix. Subsequently, Fe was removed and collected from the column with MQ H 2 O followed by 3 N HNO 3 . Then 100 lL 30% H 2 O 2 was added to the Fe fractions and they were evaporated to dryness overnight. Multiple passes (2-3) through this procedure was sufficient to remove isobaric interferences (e.g., Cr, Ni) that may affect Fe isotopic measurements. In preparation for mass spectrometry, the Fe fractions were treated with 500 lL concentrated HNO 3 and 50 lL of 30% H 2 O 2 in order to remove any remaining organic compounds.</p><p>The Fe isotopic compositions of the samples and standards were measured on a Thermo Scientific Ò Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS in the Institut fu ¨r Mineralogie at the Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. Samples and standards were measured in high mass resolution mode (mass resolving power of $12,000) so as to fully resolve the Fe peaks from molecular interferences. To enable concurrent massdependent and internally normalized (mass-independent) data collection, a Cu solution (Alfa Aesar, Specpure) was added to the purified Fe aliquot of samples and standards prior to analyses to yield 2 ppm Cu. The use of Cu as an ''element spike" to correct instrumental mass bias has been previously described (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arnold et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Weyer et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Oeser et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Schuth et al., 2015)</ref>. To obtain Fe mass-dependent data (given in d-notation), instrumental mass bias was corrected using external normalization and the exponential law ( 63 Cu/ 65 Cu = 2.24359, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berglund and Wieser, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Rosman and Taylor, 1998)</ref>. To obtain Fe mass-independent data (given in e-notation), instrumental mass bias was corrected using the exponential law, normalizing to 57 Fe/ 54 Fe = 0.36255 <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Taylor et al., 1992)</ref>. The commercially available IRMM-014 Fe reference material was also doped with Cu in the same way as the sample solutions. Samples were measured three times each using the following sequence: IRMM-014-sample1-sample2-IR MM-014-sample3-sample4-IRMM-014. The isotope compositions of the samples are reported relative to the two bracketing IRMM-014 standards. Terrestrial rock standards and the in-house standard ETH Fe salt (from ETH Zu ¨rich, Switzerland) were also used to verify mass spectrometry procedures. All isotope beams were collected utilizing 10 11 O resistors with the exception of 56 Fe, where a 10 10 O resistor was used due to the higher signal for the most abundant isotope of Fe. An individual measurement consisted of 30 cycles using the cup configuration from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Using a two-line data acquisition method, Cu isotopes were collected using 4 s integration times and all four Fe isotopes along with the interference monitors 53 Cr and 60 Ni were collected using 8 s integration times. Samples and standards were matched in Fe concentration to be within $10% of each other. Typical signal intensities on 56 Fe were around 35-50 V (on 10 10 O resistor) for 6-8 ppm Fe solutions. Samples were measured during two different analytical sessions and the external reproducibility (2SD) of the IRMM-014 reference material during the two separate sessions was ±0.05 and ±0.08 for d 56/54 Fe (massdependent). The 2SD of repeat analyses of the IRMM-014 reference material during two different measurement sessions was ±0.24 and ±0.29 for e 56 Fe and ±1.74 and ±1.46 for e 58 Fe (mass-independent). The electronic annex has more information regarding the precision and accuracy of our methods.</p><p>In this work, the mass-independent Fe isotopic compositions are internally normalized to a fixed isotope ratio 57 Fe/ 54 Fe as described above, resulting in any anomalies displayed as variations in e 56 Fe and e 58 Fe. This normalization scheme was used in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Dauphas et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Cook and Schönbächler, 2017)</ref> and is the most favorable normalization scheme to show isotopic anomalies based on how the isotopes of Fe are created (see electronic annex).

Briefly, this purification procedure employs both cationand anion-exchange resins, as well as various mixtures of HCl-acetone, HCl-acetic acid, and diluted HCl-HF and HNO 3 -HF solutions. The entire chemical procedure usually results in yields &gt;70% and a procedural blank of $5 ng, which is negligible, considering over 1 mg Ni was processed per sample. Spiked Ni isotope measurements for the investigation of mass-dependent fractionation were performed using the Nu Plasma II MC-ICPMS at Indiana University in Bloomington, following the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Wang and Wasylenki (2017)</ref>. Using 350 ppb Ni solutions, this measurement setup yields an external reproducibility of ±0.06 (2SD) for d 60/58 Ni in medium resolution mode.

Possible contributions on the mass-dependent isotopic signatures from non-terrestrial Ni isotope compositions (i.e., nucleosynthetic isotope variation) were obtained using the internally normalized measurements (performed in the Institut fu ¨r Planetologie at the University of Mu ¨nster using a Thermo Scientific Ò Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS) of an unspiked solution of bulk Egg 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Render et al., 2018)</ref>. This resulted in contributions of up to $0.08‰, which is similar to the external reproducibility of our method and almost negligible compared to the degree of mass-dependent fractionation (e.g., d 60/58 Ni measured = +4.32; d 60/58 Ni corrected = +4.24) seen in these samples. The external reproducibility (2SD) for the mass-independent Ni isotope compositions were ±0.08 for e 60 Ni, ±0.18 for e 62 Ni, and ±0.60 for e 64 Ni.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Given the refractory nature of CAIs and their constituents, elements with moderately volatile behavior, such as Fe, are not expected to be abundant in CAIs. The predicted low abundance of indigenous Fe in CAIs means that secondary Fe, particularly when Fe is found at the wt% level, can effectively overprint any original isotopic signature that was present in the CAI. Previous literature has reported that Fe in meteoritic components such as CAIs and chondrules (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mullane et al., 2005)</ref> is highly susceptible to nebular and/or parent body alteration. Therefore, before assigning a meaning to the measured Fe isotopic variations in our CAIs, we here use the Mg, Ca, and U mass-dependent isotope fractionations of individual CAIs in combination with their respective REE patterns to assess their formation history and any subsequent processing or potential alteration. The combination of mass-dependent isotope signatures along with REE patterns can help us to understand the condensation and evaporation events experienced by these CAIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The relationship between d 25/24 Mg, d 44/40 Ca, petrologic type, and REE pattern in CAIs</head><p>The Mg isotopic compositions of our CAIs show stark differences between fine-grained and igneous inclusions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). In particular, fine-grained CAIs, which have not undergone melting, are characterized by light Mg isotope compositions (d 25/24 Mg values range between À0.5 and À1.3). In comparison, igneous CAIs, which were thermally processed, display heavy d 25/24 Mg signatures (ranging between +3.0 and +4.8). For mass-dependent Ca isotopic compositions, most CAIs of this work have isotopically light d 44/40 Ca compositions relative to the BSE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>), regardless of their petrologic classification. Our samples are consistent with previous literature data, yet span a larger range (d 44/40 Ca: À8.28 to +4.10), including one CAI with a heavy d 44/40 Ca signature (CAI 173, d 44/40 Ca = +4.10). This particular CAI is a fine-grained/altered Type A inclusion with a group III REE pattern and contains significant amounts of secondary minerals such as sodalite and nepheline <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Brennecka et al., 2017a)</ref>, all of which exemplify its complex history. However, the simplest explanation of its heavy d 44/40 Ca signature would be extensive evaporation of Ca.</p><p>In addition to being related to their petrologic type, the d 25/24 Mg compositions of the CAIs are also consistent with their REE patterns, as all group II CAIs have light d 25/24 Mg compositions whereas all group I CAIs are characterized by heavy d 25/24 Mg compositions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). The CAIs with group II REE patterns are believed to have formed from a gas from which an ultra-refractory component had previously been removed; therefore, this pattern indicates gas/solid separation during incomplete evaporation or fractional condensation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Boynton, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Davis and Grossman, 1979)</ref>. Interestingly, the group III CAIs have variable d 25/24 Mg values ranging from À0.5 to +4.1, depending on whether they are fine-grained or igneous. The group III REE pattern is relatively unfractionated except for negative anomalies in Eu and Yb, both of which are more volatile than the other REE. Similarly, and in agreement with previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Simon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bermingham et al., 2018)</ref>, the d 44/40 Ca signatures of our CAIs are also related to their REE patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). For example, CAIs with lighter d 44/40 Ca signatures ranging from À8.28 to À1.40 have group II REE patterns. In comparison, CAIs with heavier d 44/40 Ca of À0.68 to +0.60 (i.e., close to the BSE value of d 44/40 Ca = +1.05) have group I REE patterns. However, unlike previous Ca isotope work on CAIs, we also see that CAIs with group III patterns have variable d 44/40 Ca ranging from À4.70 to +4.10 (CAI 165, CAI 171, CAI 173), again depending on whether they are fine-grained or igneous inclusions. In contrast to the bulk CAIs, the mineral separates from Egg 2 span a small range for d 44/40 Ca of +0.02 to +0.40, which is within the values previously reported for inter-mineral fractionation in silicates (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Huang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Ryu et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Feng et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schiller et al., 2016)</ref>. In summary, isotopic differences in d 25/24 Mg and d 44/40 Ca are observed for all CAIs of this work, and these appear to be related to their REE patterns and their petrologic type (i.e., fine-grained or igneous). Therefore, combining the mass-dependent Mg and Ca signatures may provide insight into the formation histories of the various inclusions.</p><p>The mass-dependent Mg and Ca isotopic compositions are plotted together in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. The lack of a linear correlation between the Mg and Ca isotopic compositions probably reflects the differing condensation temperatures of the elements. Calcium has a 50% T C of $1520 K, whereas Mg has a 50% T C of $1340 K <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Lodders, 2003)</ref>. As the difference between these temperatures is $180 K, this may play a role in the observed isotopic differences. For example, at a temperature of $1520 K about half of the Ca is expected to condense, whereas very little, if any, Mg would have condensed, resulting in very different Ca and Mg isotopic behavior in the condensate. However, regardless of the lack of a linear correlation between the two elements for all samples, the clear distinction between fine-grained CAIs and igneous CAIs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) suggests that each of these two types underwent distinct formation histories.</p><p>The cause of the Mg and Ca isotopic variations among these CAIs is most likely related to multiple hightemperature condensation and/or evaporation processes in the solar nebula. This has previously been reported for elements such as Si and Ti along with Mg and Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Niederer and Papanastassiou, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Davis et al., 2018</ref>; and references therein). For example, all CAIs with group II REE patterns have isotopically light d 25/24 Mg and d 44/40 Ca values, consistent with kinetic isotope fractionation during condensation. In comparison, CAIs that do not lack the ultra-refractory component exhibit nearchondritic d 44/40 Ca values (chondrites span a range of d 44/40 Ca from +0.10 to +1.54; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bermingham et al., 2018)</ref>, heavier d 25/24 Mg compositions relative to group II CAIs, and flat REE patterns. On the other hand, CAIs with group III REE patterns span wider ranges in both d 44/40 Ca and d 25/24 Mg. The isotope compositions of these CAIs likely reflect that these samples or their precursor materials experienced multiple thermal events (causing isotopic variability) under changing redox conditions (as these group III CAIs have depletions in the redox sensitive Eu and Yb; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Ruzicka et al., 2012)</ref>. Overall, the light d 44/40 Ca signatures of most CAIs probably reflect the isotopic compositions of early formed precursor condensates that were enriched in the lighter isotopes, regardless of inclusion type and subsequent history (which for igneous CAIs involved re-melting). For Mg, the fine-grained CAIs have light d 25/24 Mg compositions representative of an early condensate, and igneous inclusions have heavy d 25/24 Mg compositions that are dominated by evaporative processes. Taken together, this suggests that temperatures during melting of the igneous inclusions were high enough to result in significant Mg evaporation and little, if any, Ca evaporation. Therefore, the combined d 25/24 Mg, d 44/40 Ca, and REE patterns demonstrate multiple stages of condensation and evaporation in these CAIs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">On the origin of U isotopic variation in the early Solar System</head><p>Understanding U isotope fractionation in CAIs is important because the 238 U/ 235 U isotope ratio is used in calculating the absolute ages of these objects, which are used to define the age of the Solar System. It has previously been suggested that-along with the decay of 247 Cm to 235 U (t 1/2 = 15.6 Ma)-isotopic fractionation during CAIforming processes may have contributed to U isotope variation in CAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brennecka et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Tissot et al., 2016)</ref>. As the d 25/24 Mg measured in our CAIs is indicative of isotope fractionation during evaporation and/or condensation processes and U isotopes can be fractionated during such processes, examining d 25/24 Mg and U isotope compositions in the same samples may aid in understanding the causes for U isotope variations in CAIs. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, igneous CAIs show a linear correlation between d 25/24 Mg and d 238/235 U (with a correlation coefficient of 0.74). Furthermore, these igneous CAIs plot along a line that has a slope consistent with a theoretical Rayleigh fractionation line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). This relationship suggests that isotopic fractionation during thermal processing of the igneous CAIs contributed to the relatively small U isotope variation in this subset of samples. Such an observation would be consistent with our interpretation that igneous CAIs experienced evaporation events that drove the d 25/24 Mg (and d 238/235 U) signatures to heavier values. However, compared to igneous CAIs the fine-grained CAIs show a much larger range of U isotopic compositions that do not correlate with d 25/24 Mg, suggesting that isotope fractionation during evaporation/condensation processes alone cannot explain the range of data by itself. Additionally, U isotopic compositions in these fine-grained samples correlate with proxies for initial Cm concentration (i.e., Th and Nd concentrations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brennecka et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Tissot et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, the large-scale (&gt;1‰) d 238/235 U isotopic variation in fine-grained inclusions is likely due to the decay of the short-lived radionuclide 247 Cm in the early Solar System, consistent with previous findings in this and other sample sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brennecka et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Tissot et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Mass-dependent d 56/54 Fe signatures of bulk CAIs and Egg 2 mineral separates</head><p>The CAIs of this work have variable mass-dependent d 56/54 Fe signatures, similar to what has been reported for other elements like Ca, Ti, and Ni in CAIs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Huang et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Simon et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Davis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bermingham et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al., 2018)</ref>. Although most of our data are in good agreement with previous work on Fe isotopic fractionation in CAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mullane et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hezel et al., 2008)</ref>, our CAI sample set spans a wider range of d 56/54 Fe (À1.71 to +1.29‰). Furthermore, most of our CAIs are isotopically distinct from bulk Allende (d 56/54 Fe = À0.03 ± 0.08). As CAIs almost certainly contain a portion of secondary Fe (i.e., Fe not indigenous to the CAIs), variations in d 56/54 Fe could, to variable extents, also reflect secondary contamination which may increase or decrease d 56/54 Fe variations, thus making the interpretation of the d 56/54 Fe signatures more difficult.</p><p>The Egg 2 mineral separates may provide an alternative pathway to investigate the Fe isotopic composition of CAIs. Unlike some CAIs that have been reported to have FeO contents &gt; 7 wt% <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mullane et al., 2005)</ref>, the bulk Egg 2 inclusion has a FeO content of 0.69% <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wark and Lovering, 1982)</ref>, demonstrating that it has not experienced severe secondary contamination. In comparison to bulk CAIs of this study, the Egg 2 mineral separates have extremely variable and heavy d 56/54 Fe compositions (ranging from +4.3 to +9.7). Previous work reported inter-mineral differences between terrestrial olivine and clinopyroxene of up to 0.2‰ (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beard et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Liu et al., 2014)</ref>, thus demonstrating that whereas d 56/54 Fe signatures can vary between mineral phases, the differences are relatively small compared to the fractionation seen in the Egg 2 mineral separates. This is in stark contrast to the small range of d 44/40 Ca signatures (+0.02 to +0.40) of the Egg 2 mineral separates that are explained by inter-mineral fractionation. Therefore, the range of d 56/54 Fe in the Egg 2 mineral separates requires an alternative explanation.</p><p>Different processes that could induce Fe isotope fractionation resulting in variable d 56/54 Fe signatures include diffusion and evaporation/condensation events. Diffusion, a secondary process, could potentially be responsible for the d 56/54 Fe variations illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, although this seems rather unlikely. In the case of the Egg 2 mineral separates, diffusion alone is unlikely to generate $6‰ of d 56/54 Fe variation, as the effect on Fe isotopes in magmatic minerals due to this process barely exceeds $1‰ <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Sio et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Oeser et al., 2015)</ref>. Moreover, because the range of d 56/54 Fe in CAIs is much larger than that in bulk meteorites (d 56/54 Fe $ 0; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Craddock and Dauphas, 2011)</ref>, parent body alteration alone cannot easily account for it. Thus, given the range of d 56/54 Fe in CAIs and the Egg 2 mineral separates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), an additional mode of fractionation is required to fully explain these isotopic signatures.</p><p>Contrary to diffusion, evaporation and condensation events can generate large isotopic variability and could be primary contributors to the isotopic signatures of CAIs. For example, CAIs with light d 56/54 Fe signatures could reflect the kinetic condensation of Fe, as this process favors the light isotopes. Another scenario could be that the heavy d 56/54 Fe signatures of the Egg 2 separates and other CAIs reflects crystallization from a melt that was unfractionated when it formed or even slightly heavy ab initio. After initial formation, the Egg 2 sample and other bulk CAIs became open systems that were re-melted and paired with extensive evaporation of Fe (probably occurring in multiple events), driving the d 56/54 Fe compositions to progressively heavier values. The change in d 56/54 Fe through partial evaporation of Fe can be modeled using a simple single-stage Rayleigh distillation model to describe the observed d 56/54 Fe signatures of the CAIs and Egg 2 mineral separates. For most of the bulk CAIs, this requires less than 15% of the Fe to be evaporated, similar to implications based on the isotope compositions of elements like Ti and Ni <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Davis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al., 2018)</ref>, to arrive at the measured compositions. In comparison, the Fe isotope compositions of the Egg 2 mineral separates would require evaporation of as much as SOH50% Fe in the ‘‘high-Fe Px” fraction as the melt crystallized. Although these percentages represent only rough estimations because the starting composition is not well-deﬁned (we use the lightest CAI for our starting composition). Finally, in order to determine how much of a role mixing played in establishing the d56/54Fe signatures (particularly in the Egg 2 mineral separates), we examine the nucleosynthetic Fe isotope variations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Nucleosynthetic variations</head><p>None of the bulk CAIs of this work display resolved e 56 Fe or e 58 Fe nucleosynthetic anomalies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). On the other hand, the Egg 2 mineral separates all have resolved excesses in e 56 Fe relative to terrestrial standards and bulk Allende. Therefore, given that the sum of the Egg 2 mineral separates would not be 0 for e 56 Fe, this is in stark contrast to the bulk CAIs of this work. As the bulk CAIs do not have any excesses in e 56 Fe, it is important to understand whether the Egg 2 inclusion is unique or whether it is representative of the CAI-forming region. Previous work on the Egg 2 inclusion hinted at excesses in e 56 Fe, but this was not resolved from the terrestrial composition (data renormalized from <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Völkening and Papanastassiou, 1989)</ref>. Alternatively, it is also possible that certain non-magnetic Fe-rich phases with e 56 Fe of &lt;0 could have been lost during the mineral separation process. Regardless, the Egg 2 mineral separates have nucleosynthetic Ti, Ni, and Sr isotope anomalies indistinguishable from other bulk CAIs (see Section 3.4). Therefore, we have confidence that the Egg 2 separates are broadly representative of the CAI-forming region. Interestingly, the mineral separate with the highest magnetic susceptibility (high-Fe Px) displays the largest excess in e 56 Fe, while the non-magnetic separate (plagioclase) has the smallest anomaly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>). This suggests that the magnetic high-Fe Px held onto its original signature, as it is possibly more resistant to alteration or more difficult to overprint due to the higher amount of original Fe in that phase compared to the plagioclase phase. Therefore, the Egg 2 mineral separates may assist in locating the primary Fe of the CAI, as phases such as high-Fe Px could host more indigenous Fe.</p><p>Interestingly, when the e 56 Fe (nucleosynthetic) values are plotted against d 56/54 Fe (mass-dependent) values in bulk CAIs and Egg 2 mineral separates, a linear correlation is observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>; please see electronic annex for concerns about an analytical artifact). Whereas such a correlation could, in principle, represent severe mass-dependent fractionation causing apparent mass-independent effects, these samples have a second-order correction applied for natural mass fractionation (following a Rayleigh distillation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Tang and Dauphas, 2012)</ref> as recently demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al. (2018)</ref>. It is possible that the mass fractionation law (s) for correction of large d 56/54 Fe are poorly known, resulting in a false correction. However, another explanation is that high-Fe Px, the separated phase least susceptible to alteration, also contains the most original (i.e., indigenous) Fe, while Fe from secondary processes is incorporated into less magnetic (and less Fe-rich) phases such as the plagioclase fraction. Therefore, we interpret the coupling of mass-dependent and nucleosynthetic anomalies of Fe isotopes to indicate that the indigenous Fe isotope composition of the CAIs that has been highly fractionated by evaporation processes mixed with that of less fractionated and less isotopically anomalous Fe that was condensed while still in the nebula. In such a scenario, the high-Fe Px separate represents the most pristine Fe isotopic composition, as it contained the highest percentage of original Fe from CAI formation. The high-Mg Px, and more so the plagioclase separate, would be more affected by subsequent contamination and, therefore, contain progressively more secondary Fe. Such a relationship between massdependent and nucleosynthetic isotopic compositions in CAIs has been reported for Ni <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Render et al., 2018)</ref>, likely indicating that both types of isotopic variations for each individual element have a common origin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Ti, Ni, Sr, and U isotopic compositions in Egg 2 mineral separates</head><p>As the Egg 2 mineral separates display variable Fe isotopic compositions, their Ti, Ni, Sr, and U isotopic compositions were also measured in order to better understand the cause of their e 56 Fe variations. While the mineral separates display isotopic variations in Ti, Ni, Sr, and U that are in agreement with literature data (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Brennecka et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brennecka et al., , 2013;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Williams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Davis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al., 2018)</ref>, they are not correlated with the e 56 Fe variations reported here (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">10a/b</ref>). For example, all three mineral separates have e 50 Ti % +9, e 84 Sr % +1.2, and d 238/235 U % À0.35, which are consistent with the majority of bulk igneous CAIs. Thus, the e 50 Ti, e 84 Sr, and d 238/235 U compositions reflect that the anomalous carriers of these elements were homogenized and the isotope anomalies equilibrated between the different mineral phases, probably during melting and subsequent crystallization of this igneous inclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Location of mixing and secondary alteration in CAIs</head><p>The correlation between d 56/54 Fe and e 56 Fe signatures in bulk CAIs and Egg 2 mineral separates likely indicates the mixing of original Fe in CAIs with Fe from later formed Fe-bearing phases. In this scenario, the original CAI component would have higher d 56/54 Fe and e 56 Fe values than the later formed Fe component, which would have values similar to that of bulk Allende. As such, the two most likely places for mixing to occur are (1) in the nebula or (2) on the parent body. The effects of Fe-alkali-halogen metasomatism, the likely source of Fe contamination in CAIs, have been welldocumented, but it is debated whether this occurred in the nebula or on the asteroidal body (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Krot et al., 1995)</ref>. By examining Al-Mg isotope systematics in secondary minerals of Allende CAIs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fagan et al. (2007)</ref> demonstrated that the possible timing of secondary alteration ranged from when CAIs started forming up to a time after CAIs were incorporated on their asteroidal bodies. As such, the Al-Mg systematics demonstrate that secondary alteration could have occurred either in the nebula and/or on the parent body. However, Fe isotopic compositions of bulk CAIs and Egg 2 mineral separates may provide evidence as to where the Fe alteration/mixing most likely occurred.</p><p>Fine-grained CAIs, which have no petrological evidence for melting after they condensed, have the lightest d 56/54 Fe compositions, which may reflect the condensation of isotopically light ''primary" Fe from the CAI-forming region and a lack of subsequent Fe evaporation. However, four of these fine-grained CAIs (166, 167, 173, 175) show significant amounts of secondary mineralization, ranging from $18% to 42% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Brennecka et al., 2017a)</ref>, and lack a strong correlation between d 56/54 Fe and percentage of secondary minerals. If the secondary minerals were incorporated on the Allende parent body where the d 56/54 Fe signature is well known (d 56/54 Fe = À0.007‰ <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Craddock and Dauphas, 2011)</ref>, then secondary Fe would have a similar d 56/54 Fe signature to bulk Allende. Demonstratively, this is not the case, as all fine-grained CAIs of this work have light d 56/54 Fe signatures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Therefore, secondary alteration must have occurred prior to the parent body phase and this likely occurred in the nebula while Fe-bearing phases were condensing.</p><p>In contrast, igneous CAIs, which show far lower percentages of secondary minerals compared to fine-grained CAIs, exhibit a range of d 56/54 Fe compositions. As previously shown for chondrules, molten extraterrestrial materials exhibit isotopically heavy d 56/54 Fe compositions, most likely reflecting heating events (and associated evaporation) that drove off the light Fe isotopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mullane et al., 2005)</ref>. Since igneous CAIs were once molten droplets, the heavy Fe isotope signatures recorded by some of these CAIs are probably manifestations of such heating events, consistent with their isotopically heavy Mg compositions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">11</ref>). However, a large portion of the igneous CAIs reported here have light Fe isotopic signatures. This could suggest that (1) these CAIs (or their precursors) started with isotopically light Fe compositions and experienced less extensive evaporation-induced fractionation than other igneous samples or (2) isotopically light Fe was added to igneous CAIs in the nebula from metasomatism. Similar to fine-grained CAIs, the light isotope signatures recorded by igneous CAIs must have been acquired during condensation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Probing the original Fe isotopic composition of the CAIforming region</head><p>The lack of Fe isotopic anomalies in our bulk CAIs likely reflects the mixing of secondary Fe into CAIs that heavily diluted any nucleosynthetic anomaly towards the bulk meteorite or terrestrial value. As such, the massindependent Fe isotope compositions reported here are secondary and do not represent the original Fe in the CAIs, but they rather reflect the Fe isotope composition at the time of secondary alteration in the nebula. However, the Egg 2 mineral separates offer an alternative approach to probe the original mass-independent Fe isotopic composition of the CAI-forming region. The Egg 2 mineral separates have Ti, Ni, and Sr nucleosynthetic anomalies indistinguishable from CV, CK, and CO CAIs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Moynier et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Brennecka et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hans et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Paton et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Williams et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Davis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Render et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Myojo et al., 2018)</ref>, suggesting that they are derived from the same isotopic reservoir as most other ''normal" CAIs. Therefore, the Fe isotopic compositions of the Egg 2 mineral separates may be a good proxy for understanding what the original Fe isotopic composition of the CAI-forming region was.</p><p>Our data suggest that the CAI-forming region had an excess in 56 Fe (likely a minimum of $2e) and no resolved difference in 58 Fe, recorded by the most pristine mineral separate. As other Fe-group elements typically display excesses in their most neutron-rich isotopes (e.g., 48 Ca, 50 Ti, 64 Ni), this has important implications for the sources of material in early Solar System reservoirs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Wasserburg et al. (2015)</ref> predicted excesses in 58 Fe and 64 Ni from the s-process in AGB stars, but what is observed for the Egg 2 mineral separates are excesses in 56 Fe, and to a much lesser extent excesses in 64 Ni compared to the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Nittler et al. (2003)</ref> stated that Type Ia supernovae are believed to be the primary sources of 56 Fe, and, therefore, the excess 56 Fe in CAIs may be a signature of such material incorporated in the CAI-forming region. Type Ia supernovae are thought to also produce the neutron-rich isotopes 62 Ni, 64 Ni, 54 Cr, and 50 Ti (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Hartmann et al., 1985)</ref>, which are enriched in most CAIs. Taken together, this may suggest that the isotopic composition of the CAI-forming region may have a larger percentage of supernovaederived material, possibly from Type Ia supernovae, than previously thought. Such an observation is important for understanding stellar evolution and the types of stars that contributed material to the CAI-forming region and subsequent regions of the protoplanetary disk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>(1) For Mg, Ca, and Fe mass-dependent isotopic compositions, fine-grained CAIs are in general isotopically lighter than igneous CAIs. This most likely reflects the fact that igneous CAIs experienced more significant evaporation, as these CAIs were once molten, driving their isotopic compositions toward heavier values. Furthermore, the mass-dependent Mg, Ca, and Fe isotope compositions of both types of CAIs are consistent with expectations from their REE patterns. (2) As evidenced by their mass-dependent Fe isotope compositions, the secondary alteration that added Fe to CAIs must have happened in the nebula and not on the parent body. Otherwise, CAIs studied here would have had d 56/54 Fe signatures similar to bulk Allende, which they demonstrably do not. Instead, CAIs retain predominantly isotopically light d 56/54 Fe signatures (relative to bulk chondrites) that are due to secondary condensation of Fe in the nebula. (3) None of our bulk CAIs exhibit resolvable nucleosynthetic Fe isotope anomalies. However, three mineral separates of the Allende Egg 2 CAI show that the original Fe isotopic composition of the CAIforming region was enriched in 56 Fe. At the current level of precision, we did not resolve any massindependent anomalies in 58 Fe for the three mineral separates.</p></div>
