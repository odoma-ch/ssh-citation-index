<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The future industrial success of the compostable bio-polyesters known as polyhydroxyalkanoates, which includes polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), depends mainly on their production using cheaper carbon sources than food-derived glucose. The existing pulp and paper infrastructure enables an alternative sugar supply in the form of wood hydrolysates. Softwood hemicellulose hydrolysates have a favourable sugar profile for fermentations and can be produced in such emerging integrated forest biorefineries. The processes can lead to varying amounts of inhibitors which can lead to the reduction or prevention of bacterial growth. A dilute acid pretreatment was used to produce a softwood hemicellulose hydrolysate containing the sugars mannose, xylose, glucose, galactose, and arabinose. To study the effects of increasing sugar diversity and inhibitor concentration, the softwood hydrolysate was mixed in varying proportions with a hardwood holocellulose hydrolysate obtained from the TMP-Bio process (a thermomechanical pulping-based process producing glucose and xylose). In fermentations with Paraburkholderia sacchari IPT 101, the sugars were depleted at different rates in the following order: glucose, mannose, xylose, galactose, and arabinose. All potential inhibitors except phenols were metabolized. The maximum cell dry weight reached 6.7 ± 0.1 g/L with 71 ± 5% PHB with hardwood holocellulose hydrolysate after 48 h. The analyses of the sugar and inhibitor consumption provided valuable information to validate approaches for the detoxification of softwood hemicellulose hydrolysates. Overall, the detoxification would allow PHB production in an integrated softwood biorefinery scheme.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>As of 2015, the increasing production of synthetic polymers resulted in approximately 6300 million metric tons of plastic wastes, of which 79% were disposed in landfills or in the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Geyer et al. 2017)</ref>. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of microbiologically-produced polyesters that can be sustainable alternatives to polyethylene and polypropylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Koller et al. 2017)</ref>. Industrially produced PHAs are poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB), poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyvalerate] (PHBV), poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB4HB), and poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate] (PHBHHx) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen 2010)</ref>. However, despite their favorable environmental profile, the current global PHA production capacity is merely 1% of all bioplastics. This low production has been partly attributed to the high cost of the typical carbon sources (glucose from corn starch and vegetable oils <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dietrich et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">European Bioplastics 2018)</ref>. To reduce the cost, softwood and hardwood <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cesário and de Almeida 2015)</ref> are being evaluated as cheaper carbon sources. Softwoods are abundantly available through the infrastructure of the pulp and paper industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sjöström and Alén 1999)</ref>. The established softwood supply is a promising carbon source for industrial-scale PHA production.</p><p>The chemical composition of softwood biomass can be both beneficial and challenging for its use as a carbon source as compared to hardwood. Both are composed of cellulose (37-43%), hemicelluloses (20-35%), and lignin (20-33%), and minor amounts of extractives and ash <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kumar et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sjöström and Alén 1999)</ref>. Specifically, softwood hemicelluloses are composed of hexose sugars (D-glucose, D-man- nose, D-galactose) and pentose sugars (D-xylose, Larabinose). In contrast, hardwood hemicelluloses consist mainly of xylose and arabinose, with only minor amounts of glucose and glucuronic acid. Consequently, the sugar composition of softwood hemicellulose has higher hexose sugar content (mannose and galactose) than hardwood hemicelluloses <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kumar et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Sjöström and Alén 1999)</ref>. Furthermore, softwoods have a higher lignin content of 25-33% as compared to 20-25% in hardwoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sjöström and Alén 1999)</ref>, which can result in higher amounts of inhibitory phenols in softwood hydrolysates, such as vanillin and guaiacol <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jönsson and Martı́n 2016)</ref>.</p><p>The effect of the sugar and inhibitor diversity of softwood hydrolysates on PHA production is still little understood. Particularly as this diversity depends on the wood species, process and conditions used to generate the hydrolysate. There are two approaches to process wood into fermentable carbon sources. One approach is to produce holocellulose hydrolysates (hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses to monosaccharide mixtures). The second approach is to generate hemicellulose hydrolysates (extraction and hydrolysis of hemicelluloses to monosaccharide mixtures) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gı́rio 2010</ref>. In softwood holocellulose hydrolysate, glucose is the most abundant sugar due to the depolymerization of cellulose. The holocellulose hydrolysate composition is therefore less diverse in sugars and inhibitors. The fermentation of softwood holocellulose hydrolysates to PHA has been successful. For example, the use of spruce sawdust as carbon source in a bioreactor yielded 61.8 g/L PHBV <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Koller et al. 2015)</ref>. However, the wood hydrolysate was added only after 15 h growth phase in pure glucose. The resulting high cell density overcame the inhibitory effect of the hydrolysate. In contrast, direct use of the hydrolysate stopped bacterial growth completely <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Koller et al. 2015)</ref>. Moreover, hydrolysate characterization was not included in the study. The authors concluded that due to the complex and ''crude'' composition of spruce hydrolysates, further studies are needed to elucidate the toxic compounds and their removal. Indeed, a preceding study on softwood hydrolysate derived from Pinus radiata wood chips only yielded 0.39 g/L PHB <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bowers et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In a similar vein, softwood hemicellulose hydrolysate fermentation produced low PHA concentrations so far. The hydrolysate of P. radiata sawdust yielded 0.23 g/L poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxypropionate) (PHBVP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Silva et al. 2007)</ref>. Nevertheless, a recent study found lignite as an effective detoxification treatment for a spruce hemicellulose hydrolysate <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kucera et al. 2017)</ref>. The lignite detoxification increased the cell dry mass (CDM) to around 4 g/L as compared to around 1 g/L with the non-detoxified hydrolysate. However, the mechanism of detoxification remained unclear. The lignite treatment did not have a high reduction of any inhibitors reported in the hydrolysate, which were initially 1.2 g/ L polyphenols, 0.05 g/L furfural, 0.5 g/L acetic acid and 0.01 g/L levulinic acid. In contrast, using activated charcoal instead of lignite reduced polyphenols and furfural below 0.03 g/L, but increased the CDM to only 1.5 g/L.</p><p>To understand the effective fermentation of softwood hydrolysates, this study reports the consumption of the wood sugars (arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, xylose) and potential inhibitors (phenols, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), furfural, volatile fatty acids) of non-detoxified hydrolysates. The softwood hemicellulose hydrolysate (SHH) was chosen due to its potential for integrated forest biorefineries. Specifically, the biorefinery concept of hemicellulose hydrolysate is to recover cellulose separately as it has multiple high value applications such as pulp, cellulose acetate, rayon, and glucose hydrolysates for subsequent fermentation to products such as ethanol, butanol, and lactic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clements and Van Dyne 2008)</ref>. The hemicellulose extraction was performed by dilute acid treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>, which can be integrated in softwood pulp mills as a prehydrolysis step <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fatehi and Ni 2011)</ref>. The dilute acid treatment [160 °C, 2% (w/w on wood) H 2 SO 4 , 15 min reaction time] hydrolyzed hemicelluloses to monomeric sugars while leaving most of the cellulose and lignin in the solid residue. However, the process promoted the formation of acetic acid, HMF, furfural and phenols arising from the degradation of sugar and lignin. While each degradation product on its own only reduced the growth of P. sacchari, a mixture of all degradation products resulted in complete inhibition of growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>. Since the inhibitors are derived from degradation reactions, further reducing the reaction time to 10 min was hypothesized to decrease the inhibitor concentration without significantly affecting the sugar concentration.</p><p>Due to the toxicity of SHH, the hydrolysates were mixed with an inhibitor-free hardwood holocellulose hydrolysate (HHH). The HHH comes from the enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass generated by the thermomechanical pulping-based process (TMP-Bio) developed by FPInnovations. The only potentially inhibitory compound was acetate, which was used as a buffer in the enzymatic hydrolysis. However, hardwood hemicelluloses consist mainly of the pentose sugar xylose, resulting in binary sugar mixtures of glucose and xylose (at a ratio of * 3:1) that can lead to carbon catabolite repression and reduce the PHA concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cesário et al. 2014)</ref>. For glucosexylose mixtures, the sugarcane field isolate P. sacchari IPT101 (P. sacchari) had the best performance in overcoming carbon catabolite repression <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cesário et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Raposo et al. 2017)</ref>. With the same strain, the specific growth rate on mannose and galactose were 97% and 60% of glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Neither of the hydrolysates had been tested as a carbon source for PHA production. Monitoring the sugar and inhibitor consumption profile in the two sugar streams during fermentation by P. sacchari IPT101 with regards to bacterial growth and PHB production can inform on-going and future efforts to detoxify softwood hydrolysates.</p></div>

After pretreatment, the biomass was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis [20 wt% solids, 50 °C, 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8)] using a cocktail of commercially available cellulases and xylanases at an enzyme dosage of 10 filter paper units (FPU)/g glucan. After 72 h, the resulting slurry was separated by centrifugation into a liquid sugar stream and a lignin-rich solid. The resulting sugar concentration was 120-140 g/L with an average of approximately 100 g/L glucose and 30 g/L xylose. The hydrolysate was heated to 90 °C to denature the enzymes and prevent microbial contamination and was stored at -20 °C.</p></div>

In short, the wood chips (200 g oven-dry basis) were pre-steamed and hydrolyzed at a 1:3 (w:v) woodto-liquor ratio based on the oven-dried wood weight. The samples were placed in 2 L bomb digesters with 600 mL water and sulphuric acid (4 g corresponding to 5.56 mL of 72% H 2 SO 4 ). The hydrolysis temperature was 160 °C and the pH was 0.87. Upon reaching 160 °C, two reaction times were compared to maximize total sugar concentration and minimize degradation product formation. The reaction times were 10 and 15 min, respectively.</p></div>

In brief, the nitrogen-limited medium was composed of medium stock solutions (buffer, MgSO 4 , and trace elements) and the carbon source. The buffer stock was concentrated two-fold. In the final medium, it had a concentration of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 1 g/L, Na 2 HPO 4 9 7H 2 O 6.78 g/L, KH 2- PO 4 1.5 g/L, and 1 g/L of yeast extract. The buffer stock was adjusted to pH 6.8. The magnesium sulfate concentration in the final medium was 0.2 g/L, and the stock solution had a concentration of 20 g/L (100-fold concentration). The trace element stock had a previously reported composition yielding a final concentration of 1 mL/L <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kim et al. 1994)</ref>. The buffer stock and the magnesium stock were sterilized by autoclaving, and the trace element stock was sterilized by filtration (0.22 lm). The medium was prepared by adding in % total volume: 50% buffer stock, 1% MgSO 4 stock, 0.1% trace element stock, and varying amounts of carbon source and autoclaved water.</p><p>The carbon source was either from pure sugar stock solution, SHH or mixtures of both. The sugar stock solution was prepared from pure sugars, glucose and xylose, purchased from Sigma Aldrich and sterilized by filtration (0.22 lm). The HHH feed was prepared by diluting the sterilized hydrolysate in the buffer to a total sugar concentration of 10 g/L and resulted in a pH of 7. The two SHH feeds were prepared by adjusting the pH to 7 by addition of 10 M KOH. The precipitate was then separated by centrifugation and filtration. The buffer salts were added to the hydrolysates followed by filter sterilization. The wood hydrolysate mixtures were prepared by mixing the corresponding volumes of the feed solutions. The HHH initial medium was prepared by adding the sterilized hydrolysate to the medium stock solutions to reach a final total sugar concentration of 20 g/L.</p></div>

Samples of the organic phase were analyzed in a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 5890 series II) equipped with a MS detector and a 7683B injector. The capillary column was a HP-5 from Agilent J&amp;W Scientific, 30 m in length and 0.32 mm of internal diameter. The injector and the detector temperatures were kept constant at 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively. Data acquisition and integration were performed by a shimadzu CBM-102 communication bus module and shimadzu GC solution software (Version 2.3), respectively. Calibration curves were obtained using samples of commercial PHB (Sigma Aldrich), which were subjected to the same methylation process as the cells. The PHB concentration was calculated using the slope and the y-intercept of a simple linear regression.</p></div>

The column was eluted with deionized water at a flow rate of 1 mL/ min. Aliquots (20 lL) were injected after being passed through a 0.45 lm nylon syringe filter (Chromatographic Specialties Inc., Brockville, ON, Canada). Baseline stability and detector sensitivity were optimized by post column addition of 0.2 M NaOH at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using a Dionex AXP pump. The column was reconditioned using 1 M NaOH after    each analysis.

The glucose concentration increased with longer reaction time, but the inhibitor concentration also increased. As previously mentioned, the HHH was obtained from the FPInnovations' pilot plant and was diluted to a similar total sugar concentration as the SHH. With the dilution, the acetate concentration was below 0.5 g/L, while the inhibitory threshold of acetate is above 2 g/L for P. sacchari <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the composition of the hydrolysates.</p><p>The fermentation strategy of the wood hydrolysates was designed to overcome the inhibitory effect of SHH. Using synthetic mixtures simulating SHH, an initial inoculum of high cell density (optical density, OD [ 5) overcame the inhibitor toxicity and resulted in bacterial growth. However, the 24 h growth yield was reduced from an OD 600 of 23 with only sugars to 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>. In this study, the fermentation strategy was to use SHH as a feed after the initial growth phase for 24 h. The hypothesis was that similar to a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Koller et al. 2015)</ref>, the higher cell density and physiological maturity would enable the bacterial population to consume the sugars in the presence of inhibitory compounds. The initial growth was first tested with pure sugar mixtures as carbon source, which was then substituted with HHH. Both conditions were run with HHH and SHH as feed solutions. The fermentations using HHH for initial growth followed by HHH and SHH feed were successful. Consequently, it is feasible to produce PHB with solely wood-based carbon sources from integrated forest biorefineries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consumption of hydrolysates after initial growth in a synthetic sugar seed medium</head><p>Six wood hydrolysates were evaluated as feed solutions for PHA production after 24 h. They were added to the fermentation broth three times at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the name and composition of the feed solutions (H100-S0, H75-S25, H50-S50, H25-S75, H0-S100, and S10 min), which are either mixtures of HHH and SHH (15 min), or pure SHH (10 min). The mixtures gradually increased the sugar diversity and inhibitor content. This allowed observing the effects of the sugar profile and inhibitor content on the bacterial growth and PHB production. Furthermore, the two SHH solutions could be compared. The six hydrolysates were fermented in triplicate in three blocks on different days. The fermentation profile of the replicates for each hydrolysate differed only in the case of H0-S100. This was also observed in synthetic sugar mixtures that simulated SHH, where higher inhibitor concentrations increased the variance in cell growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>. Among the hydrolysates, H0-S100 had the highest inhibitor concentration, and the highest cell growth variance, which reflected the inhibitory effect of the hydrolysate component on bacterial cells (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2,</ref>CDM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CDM and PHB</head><p>The bacteria were grown in the sugar seed medium for 24 h to 4.4 g/L. Upon addition of fresh carbon source in the form of the six wood hydrolysates, the CDM increased to 4.8-5.9 g/L (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, CDM), the lowest for H0-S100 and highest for H100-S0. Since H100-S0 does not contain inhibitors and has the highest glucose content, it was anticipated that its use as a carbon source would result in the highest CDM and mass among the hydrolysates. Yet, within the first 48 h, the difference in CDM and mass amongst the hydrolysates was not statistically significant (p \ 0.05) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, CDM indicated by *). Upon the second and third addition of hydrolysates, the fermentation broth was diluted (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in CDM. The mass stayed constant for H100-S0 and decreased for the other hydrolysates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, Mass). As fermentation time increased, the differences in CDM became more significant. For example, at 72 h, H100-S0 had the highest mean CDM and was significantly different to the lowest mean CDM corresponding to H0-S100. Moreover, when the fermentation time was extended to 96 h, H100-S0 became significantly different to the two lowest means corresponding to the two softwood hydrolysates (H0-S100 and S10 min). Finally, throughout the entire fermentation period, the hydrolysate mixtures from H75-S25 to H25-S75 were not significantly different from either the highest or the lowest means. This could indicate a comparable sugar consumption pattern among the hydrolysates provided that the inhibitor concentration remains comparatively low. Upon further feed addition at 48 h, the nonmetabolized inhibitors accumulated (see section on Degradation products), which might have caused the decreased CDM for the hydrolysates with higher inhibitor content (H0-S100 and S10 min).</p><p>During the fermentation, the changing environment in the different media can have an effect on the PHB metabolism of the cells. The PHB content at 24 h was low (average 33%), which can be explained by the low sugar concentration in the seed medium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, PHB). This sugar concentration was chosen to allow for bacterial growth, while fully depleting glucose within 24 h thereby promoting xylose consumption. Within 48 h, the PHB concentration increased to 3.1-4.7 g/L, being highest for H100-S0. Upon further addition of the hydrolysates, the PHB was consumed which was possibly due to carbon depletion. The total sugar concentration dropped to 3 g/L at 72 h and 96 h, among which glucose and mannose concentrations dropped to 0 g/L. Between 24 and 48 h, the sugars consumption was used for PHB production and after 48 h, the cells were saturated with PHB. Further sugar feed is likely consumed for cell maintenance. Since PHB is produced in an excess of carbon source, the depletion of glucose and mannose might lead to PHB mobilization to maintain the cells.</p><p>The maximum PHB content reached was 79%. A previous study, which also used the same P. sacchari strain, reported 60.3% and 72% PHB in shake flask cultures with glucose (20 g/L, 29 h) and simulated hydrolysate (32.4 g/L glucose, 12.9 g/L xylose and 4.5 g/L arabinose, 70 h) as respective carbon source, reaching an overall CDM of 6.3 g/L and 6.0 g/L respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cesário et al. 2014)</ref>. Together these results indicate that the strain is able to metabolize the wood carbon sources to PHA, reaching similar yields as with pure sugar mixtures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sugars</head><p>The total sugar consumption showed a similar tendency as the CDM. Specifically, after 48 h, 3.9-6.7 g/ L sugars were consumed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Total Sugars). The lowest sugar consumption was exhibited by cultures fed with H0-S100, while the highest by those fed with H75-S25 and H100-S0. This can be attributed either to the higher glucose content of the hardwood hydrolysate or to the lower inhibitor concentration. After 48 h, the total sugars remained constant. Among the sugars, glucose was fully depleted at 36 h for all hydrolysates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Glucose). The S10 min hydrolysate had the lowest glucose content and as expected, showed the fastest depletion at 30 h. As was also expected due to their differences in metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lehninger et al. 2017)</ref>, mannose consumption exhibited a lower rate than that of glucose, yet it was fully consumed within 48 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Mannose). Surprisingly, galactose content increased with the second and third hydrolysate addition despite having a low initial concentration (\ 1 g/L) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Galactose). Only in the case of the H75-S25 hydrolysate, the initial galactose (0.242 g/L) was consumed within 48 h and was metabolized upon further hydrolysate addition. In contrast, higher initial galactose content, as in the case for the hydrolysates composed of 50% SHH and higher, galactose was not fully metabolized within 48 h.</p><p>Due to a similar xylose concentration in the initial softwood and hardwood hydrolysates, and the leftover xylose from the initial sugar medium, the initial xylose concentration ranged between 4.29 and 5.06 g/L for all hydrolysates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, Xylose). Interestingly, P. sacchari exhibited a similar xylose consumption pattern for all hydrolysates. Specifically, the initial xylose concentration decreased by 0.550-1.680 g/L within 48 h and remained constant afterwards. On the other hand, arabinose was not consumed even at concentrations as low as 0.095 g/L. While previous studies have used softwood hydrolysates as a carbon source for PHA production, the consumption patterns of the different sugars were not discussed. This was likely due to the fact that glucose was the major component in the holocellulose hydrolysates. For example, two softwood holocellulose hydrolysates contained 18.3 g/L and 20.6 g/L glucose, with each of the remaining sugars (xylose, mannose, galactose, arabinose) having a concentration below 2.5 g/L, and thus being negligible in comparison to glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bowers et al. 2014)</ref>. Similarly, a different softwood hydrolysate had a total sugar concentration of 14.9 g/L with 10.4 g/L xylose and 4.5 g/L glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kucera et al. 2017)</ref>. The high xylose content indicated that mostly hemicellulose was hydrolyzed during the treatment. Due to the softwood hemicellulose composition, it is likely that the hexose sugars mannose and galactose were also present in similar concentrations as xylose. In comparison, many studies on sugar consumption with glucose-xylose mixtures exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>. For example, one study showed the optimal glucose-xylose mixtures in synthetic medium with pure sugars <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Raposo et al. 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Degradation products</head><p>While softwood hemicellulose sugars were known to be metabolized by P. sacchari <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>, the consumption of sugar and lignin degradation products was unknown. The potentially inhibitory compounds had a low initial concentration as a result of the three-fold dilution (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). In the case of the furans, both HMF and furfural were depleted within 48 h and continued to be metabolized for the duration of the experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, HMF, furfural). Additionally, VFAs were also depleted (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, acetate, glycolate, formate) which indicates their metabolic consumption. Glycolate and formate increased again after 48 h, which indicates that they are also formed during metabolic activity.</p><p>In contrast to HMF and furfural, phenolic compounds were not consumed over the course of the fermentation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, phenols). This is problematic for fed-batch bioreactor fermentations, since the feed is continuously added upon carbon source consumption. Thus, the phenols would accumulate with increasing feed addition and inhibit bacterial growth in the course of the fermentation. In a previous model study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>, phenols were indeed identified as the most inhibitory compound for P. sacchari growth, especially when present in mixtures with acetate, HMF and furfural. As an example, a softwood hydrolysate had to be detoxified to be a suitable carbon source for PHA production with P. sacchari and Burkholderia cepacia <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kucera et al. 2017)</ref>. Despite detoxification, cell growth and PHB content for both species reached only 4 g/L and 2 g/L PHB after 72 h respectively. Therefore, fermentation inhibitors present in softwood hydrolysates are a challenge that needs to be addressed to obtain high PHA yields. However, since P. sacchari is able to metabolize all inhibitors except phenols, for further bioreactor use it might be necessary to remove phenolic compounds with the detoxification treatment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consumption of wood hydrolysate components with HHH seed medium</head><p>After the successful uptake of wood carbon sources following the initial growth phase, the next step was to use wood hydrolysates as sole carbon source. To this end, the inhibitor-free HHH medium was used directly in the seed medium, followed by the addition of either H100-S0 or H0-S100. All analyses were performed in triplicates. The statistical difference was evaluated for the means of CDM, PHB content and total sugars.</p><p>After 24 h, the average CDM reached 5.9 g/L (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). This value is 1.5 g/L higher than that obtained with the pure sugar seed medium. In previous fermentations to lactic acid, the HHH from the TMP-Bio process showed that the glucose consumption rate increased by a factor of two as compared to the same amount of synthetic sugars <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Wafa Al Dajani et al. 2013)</ref>. The author attributed the faster fermentation to higher nutrient levels in the HHH (for example calcium, phosphorous, and sulfur), which are released into the medium during enzymatic hydrolysis. As a consequence of the higher initial CDM, the component consumption changed. The maximum CDM reached 6.2 g/L for H0-S100 and 6.7 g/L for H100-S0 at 48 h. This made little difference to the initial CDM, since the starting CDM was already very high for P. sacchari fermentation in similar conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dietrich et al. 2018)</ref>. Nevertheless, the CDM was significantly different for H100-S0 (HHH) and H0-S100 (SHH) at 30 h and 48 h (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, indicated by a, b). However, the actual difference between the averages are rather small (0.3 g/L at 30 h, 0.2 g/L at 36 h and 0.5 g/L at 48 h), so that the statistical difference reflects the low variation within the experimental replicates (Supplementary information, p. S.7-10).</p><p>Similar to the constant CDM, the PHB content stays constant at approximately 70% for all time points (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Indeed, the PHB content is not statistically different for the two hydrolysates (Supplementary information, p. S.11-14). Since the high CDM at 24 h indicates that the cells are in stationary phase, then the constant PHB content shows that the cells use the carbon sources of the medium for maintenance, instead of consuming the accumulated PHB.</p><p>With the high initial CDM, the consumption of the components was fast (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). Glucose was completely consumed after 36 h. Furthermore, xylose consumption after 48 h reached 0.84 g/L (H0-S100) and 2.13 g/L (H100-S0). The total sugar consumption is 4.65 g/L and 6.61 g/L for H0-S100 and H100-S0, respectively. The total sugars concentrations are significantly different at 30 h, 36 h, and 48 h (indicated by a, b). HMF and furfural both depleted at 30 h. The VFAs are depleted after 48 h while phenols, as expected, remained constant as they are not metabolized by P. sacchari. Therefore, the lack of inhibitors and high glucose content make HHH an effective carbon source for PHB production with P. sacchari, while SHH requires further detoxification to be used for PHB production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The sugar and inhibitor profile of softwood hemicellulose hydrolysates influenced the CDM throughout the course of the fermentation. The sugars were consumed in decreasing order as follows: glucose, mannose, xylose, galactose, and arabinose. Additionally, potential inhibitors (i.e. volatile fatty acids and furans) were metabolized while phenols were not metabolized and accumulated when a fed batch approach was employed.</p><p>Softwood hemicellulose hydrolysate was fermented to PHB when added after an initial growth phase to overcome its inhibitory effects. Yet, the softwood hydrolysates reduced the CDM compared to the inhibitor-free hardwood hydrolysate. Since phenols are not consumed, further detoxification strategies should focus on their removal.</p><p>The inhibitor free hardwood holocellulose hydrolysate from the TMP-Bio process is a promising carbon source with the bacterium P. sacchari IPT 101. The strain grew to 5.9 g/L CDM within 24 h, as compared to 4.4 g/L using pure sugars.</p><p>The hardwood and softwood hydrolysates represent promising carbon sources from emerging forest biorefinery concepts. To further investigate the potential of softwood hemicellulose hydrolysates, targeted detoxification is a challenge that needs to be addressed.</p></div>
