<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite a number of empirical studies showcasing the power of online customer communities in fostering customer loyalty, the underlying theoretical foundations for this phenomenon remain unclear. Drawing upon psychological contract theory, this study aims to provide a new perspective to understand the exchange relationship between e-retailers and customers through online customer communities. The proposed research model extends the classic trust-commitment framework and incorporates the constructs of feelings of gratitude and personal reciprocity. It addresses the psychological process in relationship development and opens the "black box" between higher-order mental constructs to investigate loyalty. The results of this study indicate that in order to build effective loyalty programs and generate economic benefits from investments in online customer communities, e-retailers should improve customers' awareness of the benefits they receive from these communities, design appropriate strategies to motivate customers' feelings of gratitude, and activate customers' gratitude-based reciprocal behaviors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Shopping in online marketplaces continues to gain popularity worldwide. In the United States, the number of online shoppers increased tenfold from 2015 to 2017, by which time approximately twothirds of Americans had made at least one purchase in an online marketplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lazar, 2017)</ref>. In China, the rapid development of e-commerce in the past ten years also shifted more than 400 million millennials from being offline consumers to online consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(PWC Report, 2017)</ref>. Although the broad base of online shoppers brings growing sales revenue, e-retailers still face significant challenges from fluctuating customer retention rates. It only takes a few mouse-clicks for online shoppers to navigate from one business to one of its competitors, and consumers can easily compare products and services from different e-retailers with low switching costs. Limited communication channels further hinder the relationship-building process between sellers and buyers. Against this background, many e-retailers start to incorporate relational exchange elements into their transactional platforms, aiming to increase customer engagement and cultivate customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kozlenkova, Palmatier, Fang, Xiao, &amp; Huang, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>One particular relationship-building initiative is the development of the online customer community. Through building and sponsoring an online community, e-retailers establish a cost-effective venue to assist post-sales services to customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dholakia, Blazevic, Wiertz, &amp; Algesheimer, 2009)</ref>. Frequent information updates in these communities also keep customers in an ongoing dialogue with e-retailers, thereby increasing customer involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Andersen, 2005)</ref>. More importantly, customers' active participation in these communities produces a large amount of user-generated content. Exchanges of ideas, discussions of issues, and resolutions of problems greatly improves eretailers' understanding of customer behaviors. Research has shown that online customer communities can bring significant economic benefits, such as double-digit percentage increases in customer expenditures, to firms <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Manchanda, Packard, &amp; Pattabhiramaiah, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>While an increasing number of studies show the benefits of online customer communities sponsored by e-retailers, few efforts have been made to thoroughly understand the underlying mechanisms of the process. The classic commitment-trust theory in relationship marketing, which analyses the relational exchange process in psychological terms, has provided a basic framework for investigating the phenomenon. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Guo, Gruen, and Tang (2017)</ref> argue that as this theory relies on higher-order mental constructs, it can only elaborate on the psychological outcome of the relational exchange process, rather than capture the relational exchange process itself. Furthermore, previous studies have largely addressed the issue from the perspective of e-retailers, emphasizing e-retailer investment in the relational exchange process while neglecting customer cognition and emotion. The commitment-trust theory has undoubtedly provided an important starting point to study online customer community. There is, however, a need to supplement this approach with a new focus on customer cognition and emotion so as to gain insights into the workings of the relational exchange process.</p><p>In an exchange relationship, one of the general rules is to achieve shared expectations regarding the terms and conditions of the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ring &amp; Van de Ven, 1994)</ref>. The relational contract, which is based upon trust, commitment, gratitude, and reciprocity, may serve to guide and regulate the behavior of the exchange parties. As such, psychological contract theory provides an appropriate alternative lens to help us investigate the underlying mechanisms in the relational exchange process, as it addresses a wide range of psychological expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Llewellyn, 2001)</ref>. Psychological contract theory was initially created and developed to understand the employee-organization exchange relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Dulac, Coyle-Shapiro, Henderson, &amp; Wayne, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rousseau, 1989)</ref>. In recent years, this theoretical framework has started to draw attention from marketing researchers, because it has shown explanatory power in the relationship marketing context <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Camén, Gottfridsson, &amp; Rundh, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Guo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Johnson &amp; Sohi, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kingshott &amp; Pecotich, 2007)</ref>. Psychological contract theory provides a deeper understanding of the customer-company relationship exchange process and explains how and why customers display favorable attitudes to companies' relationship investments <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Guo et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Following the psychological contract perspective, I investigated the following question in this research: How does online customer community cultivate loyal customers? I proposed that customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and customers' feelings of gratitude to e-retailers are the critical bridging factors between customer-community relation and customer-e-retailer relation. Customer cognition and emotion both play an important role in obliging customers' reciprocal behaviors. The general and implicit obligations are the impetus for the formation of exchange relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blau, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gouldner, 1960)</ref>.</p><p>I collected data from three online customer communities to validate the hypotheses and tested the model using the method of structural equation modeling. The paper contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, it goes beyond traditional commitment-trust theory and proposes a new angle to understand the phenomenon of using online customer communities as a relationship management tool. Rather than solely focusing on the higher-order mental constructs which concern the exchange outcomes, this paper investigates the underlying psychological basis in the exchange process. Second, it provides new insights into the dyadic relationship structure from a customer's perspective. This supplements existing research which mainly focuses on the e-retailer's perspective. Finally, the results from the empirical study have critical managerial implications which offer practical suggestions to e-retailers on how to cultivate customer loyalties through online customer communities by gaining a deeper understanding of customer cognition and emotion.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. First, I introduce the research context and theoretical background. Second, I build the research model upon psychological contract theory and propose hypothesized relationships. Third, I describe the research design and the data collection process. Fourth, I report and discuss the data analysis results. Finally, I conclude the paper by summarizing research findings, explaining implications, and discussing limitations and future research directions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Cultivating loyal customers through online community</head><p><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Williams and Cothrel (2000)</ref> define an online community as an aggregation of people who share a common interest in online platforms. Online customer communities that are built or sponsored by e-retailers gather together individuals who share similar interests and these communities have been considered as customers' playgrounds in terms of the online shopping experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bi &amp; Vogel, 2013)</ref>. They are social extensions of e-retailers' transitional channels and supplement their ecommerce platforms. With the development of information technologies, online customer communities have evolved with different formats, such as online discussion forums, wikis, blogs, micro-blogs, and social networking sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>From a marketing point of view, online customer community has important implications for relationship building between customer and e-retailer. First, online customer communities allow users to create, initiate, publish, circulate, and use information in a participatory and collaborative fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kaplan &amp; Haenlein, 2010)</ref>. The user-generated content on consumption-related topics such as fashion, leisure, and entertainment provides more concrete and multidimensional information about customers and enables e-retailers to develop effective marketing programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kim, Choi, Qualls, &amp; Han, 2008)</ref>. Second, customers' satisfactory experience in an e-retailer's online community can lead to positive word-of-mouth publicity, customer repurchasing, and increased brand loyalty. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bagozzi and Dholakia (2006)</ref>, the relationships formed among like-minded customers who share an interest in the same e-retailer are "credible and impactful in persuading and bonding customers to the brand, leading them to make more purchase behaviours" (p. 46).</p><p>In recent years, an increasing number of empirical studies has provided evidence for the positive relationship between online customer community-building and customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adjei, Noble, &amp; Noble, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Algesheimer, Borle, Dholakia, &amp; Singh, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">De Valck, Van Bruggen, &amp; Wierenga, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schau, Muñiz Jr, &amp; Arnould, 2009)</ref>. Researchers also begin to use different theoretical lenses to explain this phenomenon. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adjei et al. (2010)</ref> propose that online communities reduce the uncertainty in the virtual environment, which leads to customers' intentions to repurchase from the same e-retailer. They argue that the conversations among community members generate more abundant information and knowledge, which minimizes uncertainties around issues like the quality of products and customer services. Such information is salient in assisting customers to make repurchase decisions. They further point out that the overall quality of these communications plays a more important role than the quantity.</p><p>Another theoretical perspective is rooted in commitment-trust theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Morgan &amp; Hunt, 1994)</ref>, which argues that aspects of relationship quality, such as trust and commitment-building between customer and e-retailer in online customer communities, are critical catalysts in transforming community members into loyal customers. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Palmatier, Dant, Grewal, and Evans (2006)</ref>, the central theme in customer relationship management is the quality of the relationship with customers. Intensity and tightness of the connection plays a crucial role in fostering customer loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hajli, Shanmugam, Papagiannidis, Zahay, &amp; Richard, 2017)</ref>. The emotional bond and sense of belonging created through trust and commitment increases consumers' psychological barriers to switching to different e-retailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dorotic, Bijmolt, &amp; Verhoef, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wendlandt &amp; Schrader, 2007)</ref>. Psychological barriers are hard to quantify, but research has shown that they have a long-term impact on customers' attitudinal and behavioral responses, and they indirectly influence customer retention rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bolton, Kannan, &amp; Bramlett, 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Psychological contract theory</head><p>Building upon the commitment-trust theory, I integrate the psychological contract perspective to address this issue. Psychological contract theory is an outgrowth of social exchange theory. It explains that social structure is constructed by a series of negotiated exchanges, which are based on obligations that are not explicitly specified but may infer a future return <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blau, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gouldner, 1960)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Rousseau (1989)</ref> defines psychological contract as "an individual's beliefs regarding the terms and conditions of a reciprocal exchange agreement between the focal person and another party. Key issues here include the belief that a promise has been made and a consideration offered in exchange for it, binding the parties to some set of reciprocal obligations" (p. 123). The psychological contract has been considered as an individual's idiosyncratic interpretation of an exchange relationship, and is highly perceptual as it represents one's perception about his or her own and the other party's relational obligations <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Robinson &amp; Morrison, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kingshott and Pecotich (2007)</ref> find that these implicit perceptions have substantial impacts on customer behavior, as they comprise mental models that facilitate the framing of promises. This results in stable mental schemas to shape one's actions. From this point of view, the perceived obligations in the exchange relationship tie the parties together by increasing the level of trust and commitment through strong psychological bonds.</p><p>According to psychological contract theory, there is a belief between the exchange parties that the actions of both parties are interdependent, and the received benefits should be reciprocated to sustain the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rousseau, 1989)</ref>. When one party receives benefits from the other, the norm of reciprocity motivates the party to repay the favours so that the relationship will continue into the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Brownell &amp; Shumaker, 1984)</ref>. However, this process is mediated by one party's perception of the other's relationship investment. Awareness of the benefits from the other party dramatically influences an individual's reciprocal intentions. In offline settings, perceived relationship investment has been identified as a primary antecedent of customer-company relationship quality which can ultimately lead to behavioral loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(De Wulf, Odekerken-Schröder, &amp; Iacobucci, 2001)</ref>. Given the similarities of psychological systems in online and offline relationship building <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kozlenkova et al., 2017)</ref>, customers' perceptions of e-retailers' efforts in building and sponsoring online communities should be a key component in the exchange relationship.</p><p>Moreover, the emotional core of reciprocity -feelings of gratitudealso works as a governing mechanism and regulates the exchange process <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Palmatier, Jarvis, Bechkoff, &amp; Kardes, 2009)</ref>. Gratitude refers to "the quality or condition of being thankful; a warm sense of appreciation of kindness received, involving a feeling of goodwill toward the benefactor and a desire to do something in return; gratefulness" <ref type="bibr">(Oxford English Dictionary, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Raggio and Folse (2009)</ref> find that the expression of gratitude has a positive impact on the receiver through affective commitment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Palmatier et al. (2009)</ref> separate the psychological and behavioral aspects of gratitude and find that both aspects of customer gratitude play a mediating role between relationship investments, customer trust, and future purchase intentions, regardless of feelings or behavior. A recent review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Henderson, Beck, and Palmatier (2011)</ref> further suggests that loyalty programs which help generate customer gratitude should be designed to build a strong relationship between customers and firms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Research model and hypotheses</head><p>Following psychological contract theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Rousseau, 1989)</ref>, I develop the research model as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">A.1</ref>. I propose that customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers are the critical bridging factors between customercommunity relation and customer-e-retailer relation. In particular, I identify three essential elements in customer-community relation: satisfaction with community, trust in community, and community commitment. For customer-e-retailer relation, I focus on customer loyalty to eretailers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Customer-e-retailer relation: customer loyalty to e-retailer</head><p>Loyal customers are the "bedrock" of a firm <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Reichheld &amp; Schefter, 2000)</ref>. They can bring long-term benefits and drive sustained growth and profitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Guo et al., 2017)</ref>. In the online environment, acquiring a new customer could increase cost by approximately 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Reichheld &amp; Schefter, 2000)</ref>. Customer loyalty helps firms save on marketing and advertising costs and dramatically reduces transaction costs. With a pool of loyal customers, firms are also able to increase cross-selling rates. As a result, online customer communities have been adopted by many e-retailers as a relationship-marketing strategy to develop, maintain, and enhance customer loyalty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Lipstein (1959)</ref> considers customer loyalty as repeat purchasing patronage. Subsequent researchers such as Jacoby and colleagues conducted a series of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jacoby, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jacoby &amp; Chestnut, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jacoby &amp; Kyner, 1973)</ref> that led them to propose that psychological factors should be addressed as an aspect of customer loyalty. They argue that psychological factors drive behavioral responses. Behavioral responses, however, cannot precisely differentiate true loyalty from spurious loyalty, as repurchasing behavior might result from a lack of available alternatives. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aaker (1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aaker ( , 2009) )</ref> also proposes that brand loyalty, defined as "the attachment that a customer has to a brand" (p. 39), should cultivate a customer's emotional attachment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dick and Basu (1994)</ref> further enrich the conceptualisation of customer loyalty, defining it as the relationship between relative attitudes and repeat patronage. They construct an integrated model of customer loyalty by incorporating the cognitive, affective, and conative antecedents. In recent years, more and more researchers have adopted the bidimensional conceptualisation for customer loyalty, which integrates both attitudinal and behavioral dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gefen, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Kassim &amp; Abdullah, 2008)</ref>. In line with this approach, I define customer loyalty as a customer's favorable attitude toward the e-retailer which results in repeat purchase behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Customer-community relation: satisfaction, trust, and commitment</head><p>Customers' participation in online communities directly contributes to customer-community relations. The three most important components of relationship quality are satisfaction with community, trust in community, and community commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(De Wulf et al., 2001)</ref>. Satisfaction is an emotional state based on the sum of previous experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Oliver, 2014)</ref> and refers to a positive affective condition that results from a general evaluation of performance in a relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Gustafsson, Johnson, &amp; Roos, 2005)</ref>. In an online context, customers' satisfaction with the community is the result of a series of interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(De Valck, Langerak, Verhoef, &amp; Verlegh, 2007)</ref>. The positive emotion accumulates over time through member-to-member and member-to-organiser interactions. As an essential factor in building and sustaining long-term relationships, satisfaction is expected to contribute to the overall measure of the quality of online relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hajli et al., 2017)</ref> According to commitment-trust theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Morgan &amp; Hunt, 1994)</ref>, trust and commitment are two essential components in relationship building. Interpersonal and business relationships are built upon trust, which facilitates customers' willingness to participate in and establish relationships with e-retailers; this leads to increased economic and social transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Pavlou, 2003)</ref>. Studies have found that trust in online communities has a positive impact on customer-to-e-retailer relationship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Horppu, Kuivalainen, Tarkiainen, &amp; Ellonen, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Huang, Chiu, &amp; Kuo, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2008)</ref>. Commitment is defined as an individual's desire to develop and maintain a stable relationship with others despite the need for short-term sacrifices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Anderson &amp; Weitz, 1992)</ref>. Customers' participation in an online community could eventually develop their commitment to the community. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Cheung and Lee (2009)</ref> community commitment refers to the "sense of emotional involvement with the virtual community, which is characterised by identification with, involvement in, and emotional attachment to the community" (p. 283). Online communities enable customers to identify with a larger group, in which the sense of belonging can cultivate strong and lasting bonds with the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Srinivasan, Anderson, &amp; Ponnavolu, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Bridging factors: perceived relationship investment and feelings of gratitude</head><p>Online customer community is considered to be a cost-effective marketing tactic because of the increased customer attachment to relational properties in the exchange relation with e-retailers. When an eretailer invests money, time, and effort in building or sponsoring an online customer community, it creates a psychological bond that encourages customers to stay in that relationship and also sets an expectation for reciprocal behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kingshott &amp; Pecotich, 2007)</ref>. Social psychologists find that when one party perceives the other party's investments in a relationship, they are more likely to be motivated to commit to the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Goodfriend &amp; Agnew, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Rusbult, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rusbult, , 1983))</ref>. When people feel thankful and appreciative of the other party's devotion, they also show a greater desire to maintain the relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gordon, Impett, Kogan, Oveis, &amp; Keltner, 2012)</ref>. Against this background, I identify two mediating variables as the bridging factors between customer-community relations and customer-e-retailer relations: customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers. I argue that customer gratitude to the e-retailer is the critical factor leading to repurchasing behavior and loyalty. It is also expected that customers are more likely to feel grateful to the e-retailers who have invested resources into maintaining the relationship.</p><p>Perceived relationship investment can be defined as a customer's perception of the extent to which an e-retailer spends resources and efforts to maintain their relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(De Wulf et al., 2001)</ref>. In the online shopping experience, the primary relationship between customer and eretailer is built through direct interactions on the transactional ecommerce platform. Online customer communities are normally perceived as e-retailers' relationship investment as such communities require e-retailers to put in extra resources. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Rusbult (1980)</ref>, investment refers to the resources and effort put into building and maintaining a relationship. People will lose their investment if the relationship ends. E-retailers' investments can be tangible, such as financial expenditures on system deployment, and intangible, such as spending time and effort to engage with customers. Through building and sponsoring online customer communities, e-retailers provide valueadded services and signal their intention to establish a long-term relationship with customers.</p><p>Recent research has shown that perceptions of e-retailer's relationship investment greatly motivates customers' behavioral loyalty by improving the quality of the customer-e-retailer relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(De Wulf et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Popp, Wilson, Horbel, &amp; Woratschek, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rafiq, Fulford, &amp; Lu, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sung &amp; Choi, 2010)</ref>. Customers' awareness of an e-retailer's effort to build online community helps them to form a positive impression of the service provider. The e-retailer's investments in time, effort, and other resources also signal trustworthiness, which results in customers' confidence that the e-retailer will meet their needs. When customers perceive more relationship investments from the e-retailer, they are more likely to be willing to choose the same partner as a continuing service provider. Thus, the e-retailer's devotion and relationship investment creates a psychological tie that motivates customers' reciprocity, which is manifested as customers' repurchasing behavior and loyalty. Hence, I propose:</p><p>H1. In an online customer community, customers' perceived relationship investment of an e-retailer positively influences their loyalty to the e-retailer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Fredrickson (2004)</ref> defines feelings of gratitude as an individual's affective response after receiving benefits from others, while he or she perceives that the counterparts intentionally act to improve his or her wellbeing. Feelings of gratitude could generate obligations through a process of emotional changes, which in turn encourage individuals to reciprocate their benefactors <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(McCullough, Kilpatrick, Emmons, &amp; Larson, 2001)</ref>. In an exchange relationship, customers understand that their patronage is a seller's expected outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Friestad &amp; Wright, 1994)</ref>. Feelings of gratitude play an important role in transforming this awareness into actual behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Raggio and Folse (2009)</ref> studied the moral reinforcement role of gratitude in a mass media context. They propose that expressions of gratitude impact sales positively, arguing consumer involvement and reciprocity result in the beneficiary's desire to express gratitude after receiving the benefactor's assistance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Morales (2005)</ref> proposes that gratitude is a prosocial emotion that enhances the performance of high-effort sellers by increasing customers' favorable attitudes and increasing customer retention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Palmatier et al. (2009)</ref> conducted two empirical studies and found that customers' feelings of gratitude result in reciprocal intentions and behaviors which positively influence future purchase intentions and attitudes toward the e-retailer. Thus, I hypothesize:</p><p>H2. In an online customer community, customers' feelings of gratitude to an e-retailer positively influences customer loyalty to the e-retailer.</p><p>Furthermore, I propose that customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers will likewise elicit their feelings of gratitude. This motivates their relationship maintenance behavior with e-retailers. According to the reciprocity theory, the perceived "benevolence" received from one party in a relationship can morally drive the gratitude the other party has to the benefactor. Feelings of gratitude have been considered the emotional core of reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Huang, 2015)</ref>. In online customer communities, when customers become aware of the extra time, money, and effort invested by an e-retailer, they should feel grateful, and be more likely to repurchase from the same e-retailer. Thus, I hypothesize the following:</p><p>H3. In an online customer community, customers' perceived relationship investment of an e-retailer positively influences customers' feelings of gratitude to the e-retailer.</p><p>In addition, I propose that customer-community relationship quality directly influences customers' perceived relationship investment of eretailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers. Customers' satisfaction with the community, trust in the community, and community commitment are the important antecedents of customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(De Wulf et al., 2001)</ref>. When customers are satisfied with the services provided in the online customer community, they are more likely to recognize the e-retailer's efforts and have positive feelings toward the e-retailer. Similarly, if a customer has higher trust in community and higher community commitment, he or she is more likely to perceive more of the e-retailer's relationship investments and feels more grateful toward the e-retailer. In general, socialization in an online environment is full of uncertainty. If an online community could cultivate customers' trust and community commitment, it means that the e-retailer has spent significant time and effort to manage and maintain the high quality of the community so that customers feel secure enough to trust unmet community members and have an enduring desire to maintain the relationship with the community. Hence, I propose:</p><p>H4. In an online customer community, customers' satisfaction with community positively influences customers' perceived relationship investment of the e-retailer.</p><p>H5. In an online customer community, customers' trust in community positively influences customers' perceived relationship investment of the e-retailer.</p><p>H6. In an online customer community, customers' community commitment positively influences customers' perceived relationship investment of the e-retailer.</p><p>H7. In an online customer community, customers' satisfaction with community positively influences customers' feelings of gratitude to the e-retailer.</p><p>H8. In an online customer community, customers' trust in community positively influences customers' feelings of gratitude to the e-retailer.</p><p>H9. In an online customer community, customers' community commitment positively influences customers' feelings of gratitude to the e-retailer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Research design and data collection</head><p>To examine the above hypotheses, I collected empirical data from three Chinese online customer communities. From 2010, online customer communities began to experience rapid development in China. Pioneering e-retailers, including Vancl, Jingdong, and Suning launched Vancl Star, 1 JD Club, and Suning Community, respectively. They accumulated a large number of customers who actively participated in online discussions and interactions. Thus, I distributed questionnaires to the three largest online customer communities in 2012. I directly posted the survey in the communities and sent individual invitations through the communities' internal email systems when applicable. In the end, a total of 674 valid responses were collected, of which 258 responses were from JD Club, 264 from Suning Community, and 152 from Vancl Star.</p><p>All the constructs were measured using multiple items on a fivepoint Likert scale. Points on this scaled ranged from 1 for strongly disagree to 5 for strongly agree. The questionnaire was designed in English and then translated the measurement items into Chinese. To ensure the reliability and validity of the translation, I performed back-translation and completed two rounds of closed card sorting with the help of my colleagues before the pilot study. The first card sorting tested the English measures, and the second card sorting examined the translated Chinese measures. Twenty-nine raters participated in the sorting with twelve in the first round, and seventeen in the second round. The Fleiss' Kappa score was 0.73 for English measures and 0.84 for Chinese measures, indicating satisfactory inter-rater reliability. I attach all the English and Chinese measurement items in the Appendix.</p><p>All measures of the variables in the research model were adapted from previously established items. Specifically, customer loyalty to ereatilers was measured by five items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anderson &amp; Swaminathan (2011)</ref>; satisfaction with community was measured by the items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bhattacherjee (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Crosby, Evans, and Cowles (1990)</ref>; trust in community was measured by the items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gefen, Karahanna, and Straub (2003)</ref>; community commitment was measured by the items adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Park and Chung (2011)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Wang, Chen, and Tsai (2012)</ref>; and the measures of feelings of gratitude and perceived relationship investment were both adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Palmatier et al. (2009)</ref>.</p><p>I also included customer's age, gender, education, and tenure in community, and personal reciprocity as control variables. Personal reciprocity is a personal norm, which regulates an individuals' reciprocal behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pervan, Bove, &amp; Johnson, 2009)</ref>. In an exchange relationship, an individual may display reciprocal intentions based on his or her internalized values and expectations. Thus, it is necessary to control for personal reciprocity when examining the relationships of perceived relationship investment, feelings of gratitude, and customer loyalty. I adopted the measure of personal reciprocity from <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Perugini, Gallucci, Presaghi, and Ercolani (2003)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Descriptive statistics</head><p>The demographics of the sample have been summarized in Table <ref type="table">A.1</ref>. More than 70% of participants were between eighteen and thirty years old, and 28.6% community members were between thirty and fifty years old. There were almost twice as many female customers than male customers, with females comprising 62.9% and males comprising 36.6% of our sample. 11% of community members had high school or below high school education, more than 80% were diploma and university graduate, and 7.6% had post-graduate degrees. In terms of tenure in community, 56.4% had between three months and one year of online customer community participation experience, while 19% of customers were new to the online community and had only taken part in it for less than three months.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">A.2</ref> reports the mean, standard deviation, and Spearman correlation matrix of the variables measured in this study. Spearman correlation was used to examine the multicollinearity between the relevant independent variables. Customers' satisfaction with community, trust in community, community commitment, perceived relationship investment of e-retailers, feelings of gratitude to e-retailers, and customer loyalty to e-retailers were all significantly correlated, but the correlations were all below 0.6. I then calculated the variance inflation factors (VIF) and found that the highest value was 2.00. All of the VIFs were smaller than the cut-off value of 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Tamhane &amp; Dunlop, 2000)</ref>, suggesting that multicollinearity was not a severe threat.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Hypotheses testing</head><p>I applied structural equation modeling (SEM) and used MPlus Version 8.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2018)</ref> to examine the research model and hypotheses. SEM accounts for measurement errors and is particularly suitable for testing multiple relationships with observed and latent constructs simultaneously. I followed the commonly established twostage procedure, in which a confirmatory factor analysis was first performed to assess the measurement model, followed by a path analysis to estimate the path coefficients and test for the relationships between constructs.</p><p>All the variables were specified as first-order latent variables. Following the two steps of structural equation modeling, I started with measurement model testing by examining the reliability and construct validity of the data. Reliability refers to the extent to which the results of measurement items are stable (individual item reliability) and consistent (internal consistency). I calculated Cronbach's alpha and the average variance extracted (AVE). Results showed that the Cronbach's alpha values of the variables were all about or over 0.7 (see Table <ref type="table">A.3</ref>) and the AVE values were all above 0.5 (see Table <ref type="table">A.4</ref>), indicating the constructs had satisfactory levels of reliability.</p><p>Construct validity indicates the extent to which the items measure the latent construct. It is composed of convergent and discriminant validity. Convergent validity measures the degree to which the theoretically related items are related to reality. Discriminant validity measures the extent of differences of the measures of different constructs. Results showed that all multi-item constructs met the convergent validity with each measure loads significantly (p &lt; .001) on their intended latent variable with the value above 0.5 (see Table <ref type="table">A.3</ref>). Although most of the variables had high correlations, the square roots of AVEs were still higher than the correlations (see Table <ref type="table">A.4</ref>), indicating good discriminant validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Fornell &amp; Larcker, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>The Chi-square goodness of fit of the measurement model was significant (χ 2 = 251.43, df = 153, p &lt; .001). But due to the Chi-square's sensitivity to sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Kline, 2016)</ref>, reliance on multiple fit indices rather than on the Chi-square test alone was recommended. I then examined the comparative fit indices (CFI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). CFI measures the proportional 1 E-retailers in China experienced fierce competition over these years. Due to rapid market expansion, Vancl Jingdong went into financial crisis in October 2013 and was forced to shrink most of its business operations. The Vancl Star community was shut down in 2014. improvement of the model fit by comparing the hypothesized model with a restricted baseline model. RMSEA considers the error of approximation in the population and is sensitive to the number of estimated parameters in the model. CFI above 0.95 and RMSEA below 0.05 indicate a satisfactory fit. The goodness of fit indices for our measurement model reflected a model with good fit characteristics (CFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.97; RMSEA = 0.03; SRMR = 0.03).</p><p>The theoretical model was then examined using MPML estimation method <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010)</ref>. Table <ref type="table">A.5</ref> lists the results of hypothesized relationships, and the summary of model fit indices. The results show that the structure model fits the data adequately (CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.04; SRMR = 0.05). All the hypothesized relationships were supported by the data except for hypotheses H4, H5, H7 and H8. Specifically, customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to eretailers both imposed significantly positive influence on customer loyalty to e-retailers, with standardized coefficients of β = 0.30 (p = .006), and β = 0.38 (p &lt; .001), respectively. Perceived relationship investment of e-retailers also had significant influence on feelings of gratitude to e-retailers (β = 0.25, p = .002).</p><p>Moreover, the results showed that of the three components of customer-community relationship quality, only community commitment significantly influenced customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers (β = 0.57, p &lt; .001) and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers (β = 0.51, p &lt; .001), and both had relatively large effect size. In contrast, customers' satisfaction with community and trust in community did not significantly influence their perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers. This result may imply that satisfaction, trust, and commitment should not be given the same weight when evaluating customer-community relationship quality. Commitment as an enduring desire seemed to have a greater impact on people's decisions than satisfaction and trust. Compared with satisfaction and trust, commitment is a stronger psychological bond in a relationship. When customers feel the continuing relationship between the community and themselves is valuable, they are more likely to recognize the e-retailer's investments in this relationship and feel gratitude to the e-retailer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Mediation analysis</head><p>I further examined the indirect effects by testing the coefficients using bootstrap method. For the 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals, the estimated indirect effects from community commitment to customer loyalty to e-retailers through perceived relationship investment of e-retailers only were between 0.045 and 0.386. The estimated indirect effects from community commitment to customer loyalty to eretailers through feelings of gratitude to e-retailers only were between 0.085 and 0.447. The estimated indirect effect through perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers was between 0.013 and 0.111. All of the estimated coefficients within 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals did not contain zero, which indicated that the indirect effects between community commitment and customer loyalty to e-retailers were significant. In contrast, the indirect effects from satisfaction with community to customer loyalty to e-retailers, and the indirect effects from trust in community and customer loyalty to e-retailers were not found statistically significant. All the estimated coefficients within 95% confidence intervals contained zero.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Post-hoc analysis</head><p>Satisfaction and trust have been considered as important factors in customer relationship management. However, the research findings indicated that neither of these factors had direct influence on customer's perceived investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers. Other than hypothesizing the independent relationship between satisfaction, trust, and community commitment, researchers in relationship marketing also suggest that there might be a causal relationship among these variables (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bateman, Gray, &amp; Butler, 2011)</ref>. A number of empirical studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between satisfaction, trust, and commitment in online settings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bauer, Grether, &amp; Leach, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">De Wulf et al., 2001)</ref>. Customers' satisfaction with the online community and trust in community members could lead to their emotional bond and attachment with the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cheung &amp; Lee, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In line with this approach, I performed post-hoc analysis and readjusted the relationship between satisfaction with community, trust in community, and community commitment. I constructed satisfaction with community and trust in community as the antecedents of community commitment and reanalyzed the structure model. The results indicated that the model fit indices almost remained the same as our original hypotheses model (CFI = 0.951; TLI = 0.936; RMSEA = 0.041; SRMR = 0.051). In the hypotheses testing, Perceived relationship investment of e-retailers (β = 0.33, p &lt; .001) and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers (β = 0.45, p &lt; .001) had significant influence on customer loyalty to e-retailers. Community commitment (β = 0.52, p &lt; .001) and perceived relationship investment of e-retailers (β = 0.24, p &lt; .001) also had significant influence on feelings of gratitude to e-retailers. In addition, both satisfaction with community (β = 0.57, p &lt; .001) and trust in community (β = 0.33, p &lt; .001) had significant influence on community commitment with large effect sizes. These research findings confirmed the positive relationship between satisfaction with community, trust in community, and online community commitment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>This study explored the underlying mechanisms of how online customer communities cultivate customer loyalty through a psychological contract perspective. In particular, I identified two crucial bridging factors between customer-community relations and customer-eretailer relations: customers' perceived relationship investment of eretailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers. I built a conceptual model and examined the relationships between customers' satisfaction with communities, trust in communities, community commitment, and customer loyalty to e-retailers, with customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers as mediators. By doing so, this studyaims to enrich existing theories and to help researchers gain a deeper understanding of the exchange process between customers and e-retailers through online customer communities.</p><p>Grounding customer loyalty from a psychological contract perspective allows us to open the "black box" between higher-order mental constructs. Commitment-trust theory emphasizes the importance of satisfaction, trust, and commitment in customer relationship building. The psychological contract perspective further suggests the critical role of customers' cognition (perceived relationship investment of e-retailers) and emotion (feelings of gratitude to e-retailers) in the exchange relationship with e-retailers should have great impact on the development of customer loyalty. By integrating the psychological contract perspective, this research focuses on customer loyalty from the underlying psychological process. This attempt could help us understand how customers construct the meaning of loyalty and clarify the misalignment between customers and e-retailers regarding the expectations from both parties.</p><p>In this empirical study, I found that community commitment significantly influenced customers' perception and emotion toward the eretailer who built or sponsored the online customer community. Customers' perceived relationship investment of an e-retailer and feelings of gratitude to an e-retailer thus led to customers' intentions to repurchase from the same online vendor. The results confirmed the hypotheses that perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers played an essential mediating role in transforming customer-community relation to customer-e-retailer relation. Furthermore, it was found that only community commitment, not satisfaction and trust, had significant direct influence on perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers. In the post-hoc analysis, a strong positive relationship was found between satisfaction, trust, and community commitment. Satisfaction and trust both worked as antecedents of community commitment, which in turn influenced customers' perceived relationship investment of e-retailers and feelings of gratitude to e-retailers.</p><p>Previous literature had the tradition of conceptualizing satisfaction, trust, and commitment as the three pillars of relationship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Casaló, Flavián, &amp; Guinalíu, 2008)</ref>. The research findings in this study indicate that the three factors should be treated differently rather than being given the same weight. Compared with satisfaction and trust, commitment represents an individual's enduring desire to maintain a relationship and is a stronger psychological tie. According to the psychological contract theory, receiving benefits from others generates an obligation which drives the receiver to respond in kind <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gouldner, 1960)</ref>. In the online context, it is challenging to motivate such obligation. Only long-term participation and involvement in the community can lead to members' perceptions of the relationship investment and feelings of gratitude. Customers participate in online communities for various reasons. People who are satisfied with the information exchanged in the community or who trust in community members do not necessarily have a clear understanding of e-retailers' investments in maintaining customer relationships. The psychological tie between satisfied customers and online community is not strong enough to elicit their gratitude. In this case, community commitment, which reflects people's attachment and sense of belonging to a community, plays a critical role in transferring satisfaction and trust into the perception of e-retailers' relationship investment and gratitude to e-retailers.</p><p>Other than the above theoretical contributions, this research also has practical implications. When e-retailers and managers adopt online customer community building as a strategy to develop long-term relationships with customers, simply focusing on the improvement of customer satisfaction and trust within communities may not be effective. They should aim to cultivate customers' sense of belonging to the online community. Such initiatives could greatly increase customers' awareness of e-retailers' relationship investment and elicit customers' feelings of gratitude. This mechanism is effective as it creates a psychological barrier to discourage customers from switching between online marketplaces and builds a psychological bond in the customer-e-retailer relationship.</p><p>One possible way to cultivate customer loyalty is through managing customer community culture. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bi (2013)</ref> found that members' community commitment was higher in individual-centred online customer communities than in product-centred and knowledgecentred communities. The frequent interpersonal interactions in individual-centred communities linked the participants together through social ties. In contrast, the product-centred and knowledge-centred communities placed people in second place, creating a culture which was not "community member friendly." Thus, online e-retailers should deliberately cultivate community culture during the management of online customer communities.</p><p>Despite these contributions, I acknowledge that this study had several limitations. First, the cross-sectional empirical design restricted the power of causal effect reasoning. Although it is difficult to address this issue in online communities, one possible way to do it in future studies is to broaden the methodology by including a variety of qualitative research methods such as through netnography <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kim et al., 2008)</ref>. The qualitative approach could potentially provide more details for understanding the effects and results of customer-community interactions. Second, our study only collected data from a single market. The Chinese context for e-commerce has its unique characteristics, which might limit the potential to apply the findings of the study to other markets. Comparative studies across countries should generate more insights on the development of online customer communities in a broader scope. Finally, as discussed above, I found that satisfaction, trust, and commitment placed different weights on relationship quality; these might be worthy of further investigation. As an emerging phenomenon worldwide, online customer communities are undoubtedly attracting researchers from different disciplines. More multidisciplinary studies should be conducted in the future.     </p></div>
