<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When working with African American adolescents in clinical settings, it is important to examine their life experiences and develop interventions from an appro priate cultural perspective. Service providers often rely on models of Western behavioral science that are based upon Eurocentric cultural standards. Anything that devi ates from these standards is generally characterized as deficit. Deficiency (deficit) models have been the hall mark of conventional theorizing about the behaviors of people of African descent. The African-centered model, in contrast, affirms and values African life, and assumes strengths, rather than deficits within the African Ameri can community. It is holistic in nature, going beyond the examination of the individual when considering problem behaviors, such as substance abuse.</p><p>The pervasiveness of racism and oppression, at tempts at cultural disconnection and suppression of power by the dominant culture, and spiritual and psy chological alienation in the lives of people of African descent must be considered whenever explanations and interventions for problem behaviors are offered <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boyd-Franklin, 2010)</ref>. The African-centered model does this by providing a more appropriate lens through which to observe, understand and analyze experiences of people of African descent, to support healing and thriving in the African American community, and to intervene when behaviors are contrary to the well-being and positive de velopment of the individual and collective. It promotes cultural sensitivity, cultural competence, cultural accu racy, and cultural relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Myers&amp; Speight, 2010)</ref>. Interventions that involve African-centered strategies and methods promote "positive thinking, interdepen dence, collectivism, transformation, and spirituality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Stepteau-Watson, Watson, &amp; Lawrence, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our goal, as authors, is to familiarize the reader with important cultural considerations that can pro-mote more sensitive assessment and treatment services to be used in the African American community. An overview of adolescence and the distinctive experi ences of African American adolescents is provided, as are present conventional theoretical perspectives on adolescents; This paper also articulates the need for a culturally relevant approach to working with African American adolescent substance abusers; key elements of the African-centered paradigm are designed and de scribed; The paper also illustrates how African-centered principles can be applied in substance abuse treatment with adolescents.</p><p>In the Western world, adolescence can be a difficult time for anyone, but it can be distinctively challenging for youth of African descent. They must develop a positive self-identity while they are steadily receiving negative messages directed against their culture. They must maintain connections with their community while the larger society emphasizes individualism. Seeking spiritual connection is often met by attitudes against this aspect of self. Development of prosocial values competes with the influence of materialism, antisocial and self-destructive temptations. Attempts to enhance self-esteem and feelings of self-worth occur within un caring social institutions; learning from elders is made difficult in a youth-centered society; healthy sexual development occurs outside of a context.</p><p>In addition to the emotional and physical upheav als, adolescence is also the period when experimentation is likely to begin. A propensity for experimentation may set the stage for experimental drug use. Risk taking, considered a hallmark of the adolescence developmen tal period, is also related to the initiation of substance experimentation. Moreover, thrill-seeking is known to be associated with substance use, abuse and addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tarter, 2002)</ref>. Cognitive functioning and decision making ability do not mature until late adolescence suggesting that decisions to experiment with substances may be more likely <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tarter, 2002)</ref>. In fact, among other public health concerns, adolescent substance abuse has emerged as a serious problem in the United States.</p><p>Substance abuse during adolescence can be the source of considerable stress, not only for the adoles cent, but also for family, friends, and others who are in relationship with the individual. Adolescent substance use is usually accompanied by personality changes, hidden activities, guilt, and suspicion. Family stress can occur as fears about the plethora of possible negative outcomes develop. Decreased academic performance, health problems, association with negative peers, anti social behavior and activities are some of the adverse consequences of adolescent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and addiction. Such use in adolescence can impair healthy growth, psychosocial development, and impede family functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moore et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Research suggests that by 12lh grade, 66.2% of youth have had at least one exposure to alcohol, 41.1% have experienced cigarette use, 40.7%have experienced marijuana use, and 3.2%and 5.5%have experienced amphetamines and cocaine respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(U.S Depart ment of Health &amp; Human Services, 2013)</ref>. According to the findings from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2013)</ref>, 34.9%of students in grades 9-12, participating in the survey drank alcohol within a 30-day period, and 23.4%used marijuana. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2006)</ref> indicates that among youth between the ages of 12-17 years, Native Americans report the highest rate of illicit drug use (13.7 percent) followed by African American and White youth (9.8 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively). Youth in all racial/ethnic categories report alcohol use to some degree. Among Whites, 16.3 percent report episodic alcohol use, compared to 14.5 percent among African Americans and 21.9 percent among Native American/ Alaskan youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(SAMHSA, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>These data suggest that contrary to popular repre sentations, African American youth generally have low er rates of substance use compared to Whites, with the exception of illicit drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(SAMHSA, 2006)</ref>. However, rates of substance use and abuse by African American adolescents tend to equalize or exceed those of Whites by adulthood. This has been attributed to later initiation and lower rates of quitting once substance use has begun <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Resnicow et. al., 2000)</ref>. Lifetime marijuana use was higher among African American and Latino males than among African American females and Latinas. Overall African American males and females had lower rates of lifetime cocaine use than White and Latino males and females. Despite having greater access to heroin and cocaine than Latino and White youth, rates of use by African American youth are lower than Latino and White youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tarter, 2002)</ref>. African American students have lower rates of current and lifetime alcohol use than Latino and White students <ref type="bibr">(U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2004)</ref>. Nearly 18 percent of African American males reported heavy, episodic drinking, compared to 12.7 percent of African American females <ref type="bibr">(U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2004)</ref>).</p><p>Substance abusing adolescents often express other kinds of problem behaviors and/or live under circumstances that may escalate their use of substances. Included among those circumstances are poor parental relationships and limited connections to school and other community institutions. Youth who have poor self-image, have engaged in delinquent behavior, have psychiatric disorders, or have run away from home are also at risk for the development of substance disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schwartz &amp; Smith, 2003)</ref>. Those who have been emotionally, physically or sexually abused are also at increased risk for substance use and abuse.</p><p>Contextual factors such as economic and commu nity conditions may increase vulnerability to substance use among African American adolescents compared to youth in other racial and ethnic groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Wallace &amp; Muroff, 2002)</ref>. Poverty is a major risk factor for substance use. Having more of these risk factors increases the likelihood of substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Schwartz &amp; Smith, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>While substance abuse is somewhat atypical for this group, it appears that when substance use is pres ent, African American adolescents experience signifi cantly more social and health problems compared to adolescents of other racial/ethnic groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Wallace &amp; Muroff, 2002)</ref>. Consequently, it is even more important for helping professionals to become more culturally competent in order to more effectively support African American adolescents as they reach for their greatness. Additionally, understanding risk factors (no supervised after-school activities) and protective factors (involve ment in coordinated, structured extracurricular activi ties) are also powerful tools in reducing substance abuse in African American youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Myers, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theories of Etiology</head><p>There are numerous theories that attempt to explain substance abuse and what leads to susceptibility. Below, we briefly present three of these explanatory models. We will also present an alternative model that can be applied to substance abuse that takes into account the cultural realities of African American adolescents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological/Biochemical/Neurobiological Models</head><p>The interaction between the body and chemical substances form the root of these explanations of substance abuse. Proponents of biochemical theories suggest that addiction results when the structure of the brain and its functions are altered by non-medical use of chemicals. The idea that addictive behavior is a disease falls within this category, as does the belief that some individuals are genetically disposed to abusing substances. However, <ref type="bibr">Winarski (1998)</ref> notes that there are many contributing factors besides the biological, and these should be taken into account in developing interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social and Psychological Theories</head><p>Social learning and cognitive models of addiction are among the most popular of the social/psychological theories used to explain substance use and abuse. They explain that addictive behaviors are acquired, maintained, and strengthened through rewards and punishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Williams et. al., 1999)</ref>. These behaviors can be reduced through the removal of rewards and/or introductions of aversive stimuli.</p><p>Social learning models often consider concepts such as coping, self-efficacy, and craving in their ex planations for substance abuse. For example, when an adolescent uses substances to handle stress and negative feelings, the expectation about the mood enhancing qualities of the drug(s) of choice help to reinforce con tinued use <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brandon, Herzog, Irvin, &amp; Gwaltney, 2004)</ref>. Similarly, when craving is the issue, an adolescent may use addictive substances to relieve the negative physical and psychological experience, thus reinforcing contin ued use. Treatment might involve helping adolescents to recognize situations that trigger use then teaching them different coping strategies as alternatives to the substance abuse.</p><p>Social identity and social bonding theories help explain how an individual's social and psychological identification predicts substance abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lilja et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Williams et al., 1999)</ref>. For example, identification with substance abusing peers and/or lack of bonding to prosocial individuals may promote substance use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need fo r a Cultural Approach</head><p>Biological, social and psychological theories may provide some insight into substance abuse behavior of African American adolescents, however more com prehensive models that take into account all aspects of an individual's functioning are warranted <ref type="bibr">(Winarski, 1998)</ref>. This position is based on research and observa tions of minority adolescents having worse outcomes in publicly funded substance abuse programs <ref type="bibr">(Shillington &amp; Clapp, 2000)</ref>, weaknesses in service to populations that do not fit the Western and Eurocentric cultural norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Harvey &amp; Rauch, 1997)</ref>, difficulties recruiting and retaining clients of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Office of Substance Abuse Services, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Longshore et al., 1998)</ref>, programs that are oblivious to or ignore cultural mistrust and con cerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Longshore et al., 1998)</ref>, and faulty assessments and resulting ineffective treatment because of lack of sensitivity to the impact of misapplied cultural norms and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stewart, 2004)</ref>. These problems are thought to be addressed by utilizing strengths that exist within the African community in order to tackle problems related to substance abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nobles &amp; God dard, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Longshore, Grills, Annon &amp; Grady, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Longshore, Grills, Anglin &amp; Annon, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nobles et al., 1987)</ref>.</p><p>While there has been an increase in the last decade of published work on substance abuse treatment in the African American community, there continues to be a need for the development of interventions that utilize approaches based on culturally relevant perspectives of the African American experience. It is our contention that an African-centered paradigm provides the theo retical perspective that can inform effective treatment planning, program development, and more generally, a return to healthy functioning for adolescents of African descent who are involved in substance abuse and related problematic behaviors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition and Key Elements of the African-Centered Paradigm</head><p>The African-centered paradigm affirms the validity of African ideas and legitimizes the African-based mod el as a way to understand the reality of African peoples <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mazama, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schiele, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nobles, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tolliver, 2001)</ref>. It fosters self-definition, self-determination, and social justice for people of African descent.</p><p>The African-centered paradigm employs a concep tual system that is grounded in the African ethos and worldview that have been passed down through genera tions. It embraces the notion that, in spite of the varia tions within traditional African societies, there have been common cultural themes in the lives of peoples of the African Diaspora <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Myers &amp; Speight, 2 0 10;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schiele, 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schiele, , 2000;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nobles, 1986)</ref>, expressed through the concept of ubuntu, unity in diversity <ref type="bibr">(Goduka, 1999)</ref>. These themes: [RJecognize the holistic experiences of human beings,and emphasize the relationships among people and their environments, and the responsibility human beings have for optimizing these relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brookins, 1999, p. 29)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mazama (2002)</ref> notes that unity of being is the fundamental African philosophical principle. Through Spirit, humans are connected to all that surrounds them: other humans, animals, plants, minerals, objects material and non-material, and events <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Nobles, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mazama, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tolliver, 2001)</ref>. As expressed by the fol lowing proverb, "Whatever is, is in its essence Spirit." Related to this sense of Oneness is a high respect for the sacredness of life, search for harmony and bal ance, as well as a shared responsibility for everything connected through this Oneness <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mensah, 1993)</ref>. One implication of this position is the recognition that iden tity is individual as well as collective, what has been termed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nobles (1999)</ref> as the "extended Self." It is the individual who exists within a larger context, the reality of which is reflected in the following proverbs: "I am because we are, and because we are, therefore I am <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mbiti, 1975)</ref>." Humans were considered to be reflections of the Universe within this larger context, embodying limitless possibilities. This speaks to the potential for transformation.</p><p>Other principles are incorporated in the Africancentered paradigm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mensah (1993)</ref> has utilized prov erbs, an important technology for transmitting cultural values, to identity other components of the African ethos that inform the African-centered paradigm. "Action and belief are not separated; they belong to a single whole (p. 15)," speaks to the importance of raising conscious ness to eradicate problems and support transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bent-Goodley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mfuni, 2005)</ref>. "That which is, is good for its own sake. Its opposite is also good for its own sake (p. 51)." This principle of twinness suggests that one can see in apparent failure the "opposite" view, e.g. success, that can replace the apparent failure under supportive conditions. Other important aspects of the paradigm include notions of time, which is experiential, dynamic, and in relationship, rather than solely based on linearity and the mechanics of the clock; oral tradition, which transmits important information to the collective; and rhythm. Spirituality, harmony and balance, communalism, community and collectivism, interdepen dence, rhythm, and fundamental goodness are among the key components of this paradigm. It is these, as well as other elements that comprise the African-centered paradigm, that can be utilized to develop more effective interventions for African American adolescents who are challenged with substance abuse issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>African-Centered Explanations for Substance Use and Abuse in African American Adolescents</head><p>Substance use among this group can be thought of as a way of coping with the experience of living in a world that has attempted to deny their humanness and devalued their existence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stewart, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Moore et. al., 2003)</ref>. And while extreme poverty can be a context within which these experiences occur, the negative impact of oppression, devaluation, and disregard on African American youth occurs across all income levels. This is not simply a poor child's reality. Substance use and abuse then may be perceived by youth as one choice among limited options as they seek to create meaningful self-concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jackson, 1995)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schiele (2000)</ref> contends that the proliferation of drugs in African American communities "contributes to the maintenance of control by the power elite" (p. 99). Under these circumstances, substance use serves as an anesthetic, a numbing mechanism that prevents the oppressed from organizing a collective political strategy to overcome their oppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schiele, 2000)</ref>. When access to power, opportunity, and institutional resources is restricted by structural racism and oppres sion, environments are created that can foster negative behavior by African American adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Stepteau-Watson, 2003)</ref>. These behaviors are antithetical to the socially corrective mission of the African-centered paradigm <ref type="bibr">(Henry-Dozier, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Several practitioners and scholars have related spiritual estrangement and social alienation to substance abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stewart, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Moore et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schiele, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Rowe &amp; Grills, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nobles, 1984)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Stewart (2004)</ref> notes that substance abuse may occur in an attempt to address lack of spiritual connection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schiele (2000)</ref> explains that in the United States, the emphasis on individualism contradicts the Africancentered principle of interconnectedness. Similarly, a focus on materialism may make it more difficult for African American adolescents to tap into their spiritual selves, as the acquisition of material goods is valued over acquisition of inner peace.</p><p>Adolescents who embrace this value orientation are less likely to seek out and accept assistance from others, as this is contrary to the expectations of autonomy and self-sufficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nobles (1984)</ref> states that Western so ciety reinforces "loneliness, separation and irrelevancy (p.249)," which inevitably will lead people to search for meaning in their lives. It should come as no surprise, then, that substance abuse may result in reaction to the lack of connection on a social and spiritual level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Barriers to Treatment</head><p>Promoting transformative change, from uncon sciousness to a more conscious individual aware of his/her place, role, and responsibility to the "collec tive Self," is a primary objective and a central reason that youth who are experiencing problematic behavior should be engaged in treatment. However, obstacles exist that, unless overcome, can block the transforma tion process.</p><p>A major barrier to effective substance abuse treat ment for African American adolescents is lack of avail able and accessible services. Exorbitant treatment costs and restrictions imposed by insurance and managed care organizations can restrict access to treatment for middle and low-income families. Treatment programs offering low or no costs services are difficult to locate as government support for human services programs have shrunken. Appropriate treatment programs in African American communities may not be readily available, are often under funded and inadequately staffed. Ad ditionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wright and Fitzpatrick (2004)</ref> note that " ... ineffectual programs that have been designed with a particular subset of the population in mind, usually middle-class White adolescents (p.656)" contribute to less use of substance abuse services that are available to African American adolescents.</p><p>Another barrier to effective treatment involves the level of mistrust that African American youth extend to social institutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moore et al., 2003)</ref>. As members of an oppressed group, African American adolescents may experience negative judgments by adults and other authority figures that have less to do with the youths' individual characteristics, but more to do with pre conceived notions that develop as a result of negative stereotypes. Thus in large institutions, such as school systems, a hostile environment is created for African American youth that does not support their healthy growth and development. In response, some youth may learn to distrust these institutions and expect that in larger systems their needs and interests are not priorities.</p><p>The relationship between the adolescent and practitioner can provide a major source of problems in treatment. One manifestation of these problems may result in diagnostic bias; the differential treatment of clients who are of African descent <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(OSAS, 2003)</ref>. For example, practitioner prejudice and ignorance may result in overdiagnosis of psychotic disorders over symptoms of substance abuse disorders. Practitioner commitment to being "colorblind" and "objective," thereby failing to acknowledge and/or address cultural issues, can also adversely affect treatment outcomes. This situation might occur out of discomfort with the conversation, or concern that cultural differences may be used as an excuse for continued substance abuse. In either case, failure to consider culture as a salient aspect of the adolescent's life can negatively impact treatment outcomes.</p><p>Similarly, unwillingness on the part of practitioners to accept the validity of culturally-focused and -relevant approaches to address substance abuse, such as those informed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">OSAS, 2003, p.5)</ref>." Appropriate training and/or retraining is therefore, required for most who will be working with these youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Stewart, 2004)</ref>. However, it is important for the practitioner to be mindful of areas where they lack competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dean, 2001)</ref>. A workshop or class does not make a cultural expert, and thinking so may lead to reinforcement of " .. .our own egocentric dominant, egocentric position" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dean, 2001, p. 629)</ref>. It is important that the practitioner remain open to hearing and understanding the lived experience of the adolescent with whom they work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dean, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Investment in conventional treatment approaches that privilege intrapsychic work while failing to utilize cultural strengths within the African American com munity that can serve as protective factors (e.g. spiri tuality, communalism, commitment to excellence) may be minimally engaging and less effective in work with African American adolescents who are challenged with substance abuse issues. Therefore, it will be important for practitioners to operationalize cultural precepts to incorporate into substance abuse programs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suggested Intervention Strategies</head><p>How do we best help this adolescent such that he or she will call on prosocial attitudes, behaviors and con sciousness that will promote the natural proclivity for resiliency and resistance against that which is not in his or her best interests? What kinds of activities can help transform youth from abusing substances to refraining from participation in behaviors that detrimental to the health and well-being of themselves and those around them? How can a practitioner guide the adolescent into a higher level of functioning?</p><p>A major assumption of the African-centered ap proach to delivery of treatment services is that oppres sion, alienation and cultural misorientation underlie many of the problems that African Americans experi ence, including substance abuse. Therefore, substance abuse treatment must involve helping the adolescent to develop some understanding of the relationship between their problem behavior and the more global issues related to being African in America.</p><p>Substance abuse is not solely an individual afflic tion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schiele, 2000)</ref>. However, this is not to say that individual coping styles, decisions, and responsibility are not important aspects that inform the treatment pro cess; we acknowledge that some individual difficulties that persons experience with problematic substance use must also be addressed in the treatment setting. Heal ing of the individual is related to the collective heal ing of the African American community. Developing knowledge and awareness about traditional African and African American culture and utilizing cultural rituals, language, and activities can help instill a sense of pride and an acceptance of an identity of someone who can contribute to his or her own development and positive development in his or her larger community.</p><p>What follows are suggested intervention strategies, derived from some of the cultural values that were discussed earlier as being part of the African-centered paradigm: spirituality, communalism, community and collectivism, interdependence, twinness/success replaces failure and rhythm. These strategies can be incorporated in treatment settings and adopted for use by mental health professionals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How Do You Start?</head><p>In treatment settings, a psychosocial assessment is usually initiated so that the practitioner can begin to understand the nature and source of existing problems. This kind of data collection is an essential component of the therapeutic process. However, in many instances, the "client" is a passive participant in this process, recit ing factual data that is recorded in a file. Similarly, the nature of the collected information may avoid or ignore the saliency of cultural factors related to the substance use. It is critical that the role of relationships with im mediate and extended family and friends, the role of spirituality, and the impact of racism and oppression are pursued during initial and ongoing assessment of youth who will be engaged in treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(OSAS, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>It is incumbent upon the practitioner to inquire about the psychological, social, physical, and spiritual factors related to the identified substance abuse. The initial assessment must be comprehensive, including specific questions about the adolescent's substance use, patterns of use, family history of substance use and abuse, perceptions about school and reasons for skipping. The practitioner must be mindful of expres sions of mistrust of helping professionals, culturally based ideas about health and disease, and the impact of cultural differences if they exist between the adolescent and practitioner. Throughout the assessment process, the practitioner must listen for areas of strengths that can later be incorporated in treatment planning for the adolescent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Azibo (2014)</ref> has outlined a three-step assessment process that is African centered and ad dresses both macro and micro level and issues that may contribute to problematic behaviors. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Azibo (2014)</ref> three-step assessment process recognizes the impact of psychological misorientation (adaption of European behavior patterns that conflict with African racial identity) on overall psychological functioning, and suggests that assessment must seek to understand the relationship between acculturation and ethnic iden tity on problem behaviors. The <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Azibo (2014)</ref> three-step assessment process also incorporates the use of Western assessment methods such as the DSM.</p><p>An effective and often powerful technique that can accompany the initial assessment process is to have the adolescent write their autobiography. Rather than a passive recital of dates and facts, writing this personal story is an active process that involves the adolescent interviewing family members and significant others, reliving experiences with the ultimate purpose of dis covering who they are and uncovering their purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mensah, 1993)</ref>. This is a tool that can help raise the consciousness of the youth as they become more aware of their interconnectedness with various people and events that may have influenced their decision to begin and continue to use substances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spirituality</head><p>When providing services to African American ado lescents, it is essential to help them connect or reconnect to the spiritual part of their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bent-Goodley, 2005)</ref>. Activities should be designed to promote the youth's awareness of their relationship with something bigger than themselves. Practitioners will encounter youth who have a very active spiritual life and other African American youth for whom spirituality has not been important. Nonetheless, connection to the divine and sacred is a critical aspect of African-centered service provision and must be explored as a way of helping to restore optimal functioning. Note that this does not assume a particular religious orientation as spirituality transcends organized denominations.</p><p>Spirituality can help African American adolescents conceptualize their situation through the lens of the power that emanates from their spirituality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bent-Goodley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mensah, 1993)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nobles and Goddard (1993)</ref> encourage the use of symbolism and imagery, such as proverbs and traditional African and African American folktales, as a means to transmit information about the importance of spirituality in the healing and advancement of the African American community. By presenting three critical questions from the African world, "Who am I?" " What is my purpose?" and "Am I living my purpose?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mensah, 1993)</ref>, practitioners can help adolescents explore spiritual issues in their attempts to adopt a lifestyle that does not include substance use and abuse. Discussion within a group of similarly-aged adolescents and/or with trusted, sup portive adults and elders can also facilitate exploration of spiritual issues. Those adolescents who are involved in organized religion may find the Church to be sup portive of their efforts to overcome substance abuse; the practitioner can assist them in pursuing this particular relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Communalism, Community and Collectivism</head><p>The African-centered paradigm promotes trans formative change, often taking an individual from un consciousness to increasing levels of spiritual, cultural, and community consciousness. The purpose is to help individual become aware of his/her place, role, and responsibility to the "extended Self" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nobles, 1984)</ref>.</p><p>African American youth engaged in problematic substance use can be helped to develop a deeper under standing of their relationship to community and their ensuing responsibility. For example, assignments can be given during treatment to research African liberationists, persons who have contributed much to the African and African American communities, both historically and in contemporary times. The youth can be asked to reflect on the lives of these persons, their contributions and how the community benefited from their work. The youth can then be encouraged to identify how they can similarly make contributions to their community, rather than simply holding up these figures as untouchable heroes and heroines.</p><p>Service learning activities also would provide important opportunities for substance abusing African American adolescents to experience the value of com munalism, community, and collectivism. In conjunc tion with the practitioner, the youth can investigate various needs in the community then become actively engaged in addressing some of the identified needs. Applying lifelong learning competences, such as criti cal thinking and problem-solving skills, further roots them in their community, while it may also affect their academic skills. This type of activity, if connected to school responsibilities, might have a positive impact on school attendance.</p><p>The goal of this work is for youth to connect with a concept greater than themselves, while the purpose of the African-centered intervention is to counsel into individual (as well as collective) consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mfuni, 2005)</ref>. These activities can bring into awareness that the adolescent's substance use is detrimental to the commu nity and additionally their continued use prohibits their ability to contribute to the greater good of the collective. Hopefully, what results is an adolescent who has more respect for self and as well as others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interdependence</head><p>African Americans who are acculturated, assimi lated, and strongly identified with Western culture may have adopted the notion that the successful person is the one who can stand on her own, pulling herself up by the bootstraps when difficulties arise. In contrast, within the African-centered paradigm, one depending on the other for support and assistance is considered a key ingredient for success. Practitioners can support African American teens to develop networks of help ers, persons for whom the teen's best interest is central. Practitioners can connect teens to specialized programs such mentoring groups, rites of passage programs, and manhood and womanhood development programs, as well as utilize the extended family and larger commu nity as partners in the work with the adolescent. The focus, as with the value of communalism, is on the we, the "extended Self." The community is to be involved in solving its own problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jackson, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The importance of the value of interdependence can also be applied to the relationship between the practitioner and the substance abusing adolescent with whom he or she is working <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bent-Goodley, 2005)</ref>. Efficacy and effectiveness of interventions are related to the practitioner's knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of the reality of African Americans. With each party's fate inextricably connected to the outcome for the adolescent, it is likely that the practitioner will refrain from the "objective" and "aloof' stance which is often presented as the position for a mental health professional, and become more concerned about and engaged with the youth. In this respect, the practitioner can serve as a role model for the youth with whom he is working.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Twinness/Success Replaces Failure</head><p>Adolescence is an ideal period to offer interven tions that strive to reprogram faulty thinking, restore optimum functioning and replace failure with success. Before interventions can occur, practitioners must believe that transformation and change are possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bent-Goodley, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jackson, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nobles &amp; Goddard, 1993)</ref>. The practitioners' hopeful optimism is a powerful intervention tool.</p><p>The principle of twinness suggests that opposites operate together, that where there is failure, problems or despair, there is also the possibility for success, prosper ity, and hope. Adolescents can be helped to understand that existing problematic behavior is not a permanent condition. Teaching about historical and community role models can bring this message closer to home. Behaviors can be modified and changed, coping styles can be strengthened, attitudes can be shifted into align ment with a sense of excellence and appropriateness, and intrapersonal difficulties can be healed. Techniques such as roleplaying and rehearsing can help adolescents become more comfortable with the possibility of the success side of twinness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rhythm</head><p>Rhythm is defined as a "recurring pattern of be havior within a given time frame" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jones, 1991, p. 622)</ref>. In the African world, rhythm is reflected in any number of things; order that comes through harmonious relationships with people and the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jackson, 1995)</ref>; internal balance and harmony on spiritual, affec tive, physical, and cognitive levels; flow of energy that drives behavior; transitions in life; music, movement, and performance.</p><p>The power of rhythm as a healing tradition has long been known in the African world. For example, Minianka medicine music of Mali manipulates sounds, harmonies, and pitches that are beneficial to the healing process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Diallo, 1998)</ref>. Sounds that are disturbing to a person physically, psychologically, and spiritually are avoided. It can be a very intriguing, innovative, and engaging activity to use music, movement, and/or other forms of rhythm as vehicles to facilitate adolescents' learning about the dangers of substance abuse, for the expression of their needs which have reinforced their substance use, or as substitutes for the undesirable substance use.</p><p>Adolescents can be taught that substance abuse negatively impacts the collective by disrupting the rhythm of harmonious relationships. Together, with others with whom they are connected, as well as the practitioner, youth can identify ways to restore harmony in relationships and plans to make this happen. Simi-larly, substance abuse also disrupts the rhythm of how their physical body operates. This may also become a place of intervention, with the use of nutritional edu cation and cleansing. A change in diet can be a part of an overall plan to improve health. This concrete and tangible intervention can also symbolize transition into new beneficial behaviors for the adolescent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harvey and Rauch (1997)</ref> note that life involves the rhythm of transition. From childhood to adulthood to eldership, each life passage has accompanying lessons, responsibilities, and challenges. The transition between childhood and adulthood is particularly important, and in traditional African culture is not simply a matter of chronological age. Calling on the wisdom of elders who were in turn guided by Ancestors, the community prepare youth of a particular age cohort, over the course of an extended period of time to become competence in the ways of adults. Challenges are placed before them, and when the children prove that they have successfully acquired the requisite knowledge, skills and abilities, they are newly presented to the larger community as adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mensah, 1993)</ref>. The new status is celebrated with the "newly born" adults pledging their commit ment to contribute the development and enhancement of the community, a commitment that was reciprocated by the community. This is known as a rites of passage process <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mensah, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>Adolescent rites o f passage programs can be developed to specifically support the transition from a substance-using to non-using identity. This is a communal activity, not only involving the adolescent but also the extended family and larger community. Modules on academic skill development, character development, creative expression, cultural learning, and anti-substance abuse activities could be included.</p><p>Many rites of passage programs utilize an estab lished cultural value system such as MAAT (based on Ancient Egyptian values of balance, harmony, truth, reciprocity, righteousness, order, justice) orNguzo Saba (based on the seven principles of Blackness/Kwanzaa: umoja-unity, kujichagulia-self determination, ujimacollective work and responsibility, ujamaa-coopera tive economics, nia-purpose, kuumba-creativity, and imani-faith). The value system is important because it provides the framework for how to live a healthy, productive life that benefits both the individual and community <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nobles &amp; Goddard, 1993)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Effective interventions should be predicated on precepts and values that are appropriate, relevant and consistent with the cultural realities of these youth. Employing a Eurocentric paradigm as the foundation of conventional approaches to African American youth who are substance abusers is tantamount to having the wrong calabash-that is, if our intention is to support the optimal functioning of the adolescent within an interconnected spiritual, cultural, social, and psycho logical Universe.</p><p>As noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nobles and Goddard (1993)</ref>, a maxi mally effective intervention must be "grounded in the same culture that gives meaning to human needs and functions; ...responds to the conditions in the target community; and addresses the real (actual) problems experienced and defined by the community" (p. 11). Traditional African philosophy and values provide the foundation for a transformative approach to our work, one that not only affirms the worth of those adolescents with whom we work, but also affirms our worth in the collaborative journey toward remembering our interde pendence as we assist them (and in turn, ourselves) in re-membering, restoring harmony and balance in those out-of-order aspects of their (and in turn, our own) interconnected lives.</p></div>
