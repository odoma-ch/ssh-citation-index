<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p>Autophagy has recently emerged as a protective mechanism in response to compressive force and an important process in maintenance of bone homeostasis.</p><p>It appears to be involved in the degradation of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of compressive force-induced autophagy in periodontal ligament (PDL) cells in regulating osteoclastogenesis of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p>An OTM model and compressive force on PDL cells were employed to investigate the expression of autophagy markers in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Autophagosomes and autolysosomes were observed in PDL cells by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and autophagy LC3 double labelling. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) and rapamycin were respectively used to inhibit and promote autophagy, and the effect of autophagy on osteoclastogenesis was explored via microcomputed tomography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, histochemistry of titrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in vivo. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) was investigated by RT-PCR and ELISA in vitro.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Orthodontic force-induced autophagy was prominent on the pressured side of PDL tissues. Administration of 3-MA downregulated bone density and upregulated osteoclasts, while rapamycin had reverse results in OTM. The autophagy activity increased initially then decreased in PDL cells during compressive force application and responded to light force. In PDL cells, administration of 3-MA upregulated while rapamycin downregulated the RANKL/OPG ratio.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Autophagy is activated by compressive force in PDL cells. Besides, it could modulate OTM by negatively regulating osteoclastogenesis and keep bone homeostasis via RANKL/OPG signaling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Animals and the application of orthodontic force</head><p>Ninety-eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_0">*</ref> weighing nearly 25 g were used in the study. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of Tongji University. The mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions at a controlled temperature (22 • C ± 1 • C) and humidity (40% to 60%) and with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The mice were fed a soft diet and received water. OTM was established as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Briefly, a nickeltitanium coil spring <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_1">†</ref> was fixed with resin between the left maxillary first molar and incisor to produce a pulling force to cause the first molar to move. The force was approximately 0.35 N, as measured by a dynamometer. The right side served as the control group. To evaluate the role of autophagy in OTM, mice were divided into four groups, including a control (n = 30), an orthodontic tooth movement (OTM; n = 30), a 3-methyladenine + tooth movement (3-MA + OTM; n = 30), and a rapamycin + tooth movement (RAPA + OTM; n = 30). The mice were subjected to orthodontic forces in addition to volumetrically equivalent intraperitoneal injection of 3-methyladenine (3-MA) <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_2">‡</ref> at a dose of 15 mg/kg/d and rapamycin <ref type="footnote" target="#foot_3">§</ref> at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/d for 7 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Human PDL cell culture and force application</head><p>PDL cells were obtained from the orthodontically extracted healthy premolars of 13-to 18-year donors with informed consent.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Orthodontic force-induced autophagy in PDL</head><p>To investigate whether orthodontic force induces autophagy, we established an OTM model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The expression levels of the essential autophagy proteins LC3II/I and Beclin-1 were higher on the side under orthodontic force than in the control group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of the autophagy markers Atg5, Atg12, and Atg8/LC3 were also higher in the experimental group than in the control group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). We further confirmed using immunofluorescence staining that LC3B and Beclin-1 levels were significantly higher in PDL cells after orthodontic force (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Compressive force regulated autophagy expression in PDL cells</head><p>To confirm whether autophagy is activated in PDL cells, we applied compressive force to PDL cells. First, we put 1.5 g/cm 2 compressive force to PDL cells for 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours and the expression levels of LC3II/I and Beclin-1 were higher at 3, 6, and 9 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The mRNA expression levels of the autophagy markers Atg5, Atg12, and Atg8/LC3 followed a similar pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Then, we applied 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 g/cm 2 compressive force to PDL cells for 6 hours and the expression levels of LC3II/I and Beclin-1 were significantly higher under 1.5 g/cm 2 compressive force (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). The mRNA expression levels of the autophagy markers Atg5 and Atg8/LC3 followed a similar pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>). To determine autophagic flux, PDL cells were treated with 50 µM chloroquine for 4 hours before harvest. Compressive force induced a reduction in p62 protein expression and an increase of LC3II/I protein expression, whereas treatment with chloroquine induced the accumulation of both p62 and LC3II/I (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>). Next, we treated PDL cells with mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus. The numbers of both mRFPpositive autophagosomes and double-positive autolysosomes per cell were significantly higher after 1.5 g/cm 2 compressive force (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>). In this study, TEM was also used to confirm the effect of compressive force on autophagosome and autolysosomes formation. We found that the number of autophagosome and autolysosomes in the cytoplasm of PDL cells was higher after 6 hours of 1.5 g/cm 2 compressive force (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>). These results suggest that autophagy appears in the early stage under compressive force and response to light compressive force in PDL cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Autophagy inhibited OTM and increased bone density</head><p>To explore the role of autophagy in OTM processes, animals were injected with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA or the autophagy promoter rapamycin. Western blot results showed that 3-MA could downregulated autophagy of periodontal tissues and rapamycin upregulated autophagy in OTM model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Increased tooth movement distances were observed in the OTM animals. The distances were significantly larger in the 3-MA+ OTM group than in the OTM group. In contrast, tooth movement was significantly lower in the RAPA+ OTM group than in the OTM group (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B through 3D</ref>). In addition, we found that OTM-induced changes of the morphology at the trifurcation of the first molar were autophagy dependent in micro-CT analysis. Micro-CT revealed a sparsely porous structure at the trifurcation of the root after OTM. A large cavity appeared on the bone at the trifurcation in 3-MA+ OTM group. However, rapamycin reduced OTM-induced changes of bone structure substantially at the trifurcation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>). BV/TV, BMD, Tb.N, and Tb.Th were lower, while Tb.Sp was significantly higher at the trifurcation area of the first molar after orthodontic force was applied for 7 days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>). H&amp;E staining demonstrated that there were messier connective tissues on the bone at the first molar trifurcation after treatment of 3-MA, while the rapamycin group had no obvious change on the bone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Autophagy inhibited osteoclastogenesis after orthodontic force</head><p>We next sought to further investigate how autophagy affects osteoclastogenesis, both of which are directly involved in bone remodeling during tooth movement. We administered 3-MA and rapamycin to OTM animals and observed a loss of structural integrity on the pressure side of the PDL in 3-MA-treated OTM animals. However, administration of rapamycin protected PDL tissues from both the loss of structural integrity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Compared with the control side, on the OTM side, TRAP staining indicated that injection of rapamycin significantly reduced the number of osteoclasts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression levels of the osteoclast-related factors CTSK, matrix metalloproteinase-9, TRAP, and RANKL/OPG were significantly higher in cells treated with 3-MA during OTM. In contrast, rapamycin downregulated osteoclast activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). These results collectively demonstrate that autophagy inhibits osteoclastogenesis in OTM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Autophagy induced by compressive force inhibited RANKL/OPG system</head><p>To further investigate the mechanism underlying how autophagy in PDL cells inhibits osteoclastic activity, we investigated the expression levels of RANKL/OPG. First, we investigated the expression of RANKL/OPG under compressive force and found that the ratio significantly increased, reached its highest level at 6 hours, and then decreased (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). To investigate the effect of autophagy on the expression of RANKL/OPG, 3-MA and rapamycin were administered to PDL cells and western blot results showed that 3-MA downregulated autophagy of PDL cells and rapamycin upregulated autophagy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>). Then, we used ELISA to test the protein levels of RANKL and OPG in supernatants obtained from cultured PDL cells that were treated with 6 hours of force loading. The results showed that the RANKL/OPG ratio increased under compressive force for 6 hours and was increased further by 3-MA in PDL cells under compressive force (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>). We further found that 3-MA dramatically upregulated and rapamycin significantly downregulated the RANKL/OPG ratio of PDL cells under 1.5 g/cm 2 compressive force for 6 hours by RT-PCR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>), indicating that autophagy might negatively regulate osteoclastogenesis by regulating the balance between RANKL and OPG expression via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>Some studies have suggested that diverse cytokines and pathways are involved in compressive force-induced tooth movement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> In this study, we found that compressive force induced autophagy in PDL and PDL cells. We also found that autophagy in PDL and PDL cells downregulated osteoclastogenesis via RANKL/OPG during OTM.</p><p>Autophagy, a type of response initiated in response to stimulation by environmental change, maintains cellular functions and prevents mechanical damage when cells respond to chemical stimuli, such as starvation and hypoxia, as well as physical stimuli, such as compressive force. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Autophagy occurred in osteoblasts during experimental tooth movement; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and autophagy levels are higher in rat skeletal muscle after compression and oppose apoptotic responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> However, whether autophagy is induced by compressive force in PDL, a type of connective tissue with some similarities with tendons in the appendage bones, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> remained unknown. In this study, we found that the expression levels of the autophagy proteins LC3II/I and Beclin-1 in PDL tissues were significantly higher after 7 days of orthodontic force. In vivo, we used the ideal force 0.35 N for OTM in mice because of healthier periodontal condition and less side effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> To simulate the PDL tissue environment under different orthodontic force levels in vivo, different compressive force levels was applied to PDL cells in vitro. We found that autophagy was sensitive to light compressive force. Autophagy adaption to different situations is described to take place in two phases first post-translational and in a delayed reaction on transcriptional level. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> We test autophagy of PDL cells under compressive force in two phases but we could not find obvious trend and results in the second phase, suggesting that autophagy adaption to compressive force in PDL cells in vitro is a rapid response. We observed that compressive force significantly increased autophagy before it decreased over time in the first phase. Consistent with these findings, other studies have demonstrated that autophagy is rapidly initiated but transient because autophagy was reduced in cells that had already adapted to stress or in which essential autophagy proteins were cleaved by caspases under compressive force. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> In this study, we chose autophagy proteins LC3II/I and Beclin-1 and autophagy genes Atg5, Atg12, and Atg8/LC3 because these markers are highly involved in the autophagy process. Autophagy proteins LC3II/I and Beclin-1 are required in the initial and late phases of autophagosome formation. Studies have shown that 18 Atg proteins are required for autophagosome formation and about half of Atg proteins comprise two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the Atg12-Atg5 and Atg8/LC3 systems, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> which function at a late step of autophagosome formation, serving as good markers for the detection of membrane structures during autophagy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> The Atg12-Atg5 system is useful in localizing to the isolation membrane specifically and Atg8 system functions as formation of the autophagosome and fusion with lysosomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> Autophagy is regarded as a new player in maintenance of skeletal homoeostasis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> which could occur during ossification such as endochondral ossification in wrist bone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> It is reported that rapamycin, an autophagy promoter, can promote the osteoblastic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> In our study, we found that bone resorption and bone density decreased under compressive force for 7 days and were associated with increased osteoclast counts and augmented expression of osteoclastic markers. What is the role of autophagy in PDL cells exposed to compressive force during this process? Rapamycin, an autophagy promoter, and 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, were used to regulate the levels of autophagy in PDL tissues. The results showed that injecting rapamycin into orthodontic mice significantly increased bone density at the bone anterior to the distobuccal root, while administration of 3-MA resulted in an opposite change in bone density. This result is consistent with the finding that rapamycin inhibited the expression of osteoclast-related factors and reduced the number of osteoclasts, while 3-MA caused opposite changes; and these results were consistent with previous studies showing that rapamycin reduced bone resorption in kidney transplant patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in patients with giant cell tumors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> These data indicate that autophagy might regulate bone homeostasis by negatively regulating osteoclast activity and that autophagy might serve as a potential therapeutic target for diseases involving the overreaction of osteoclasts. Although the increase of autophagy reduces the speed of OTM, it has a good protective effect on periodontal tissues. Adjusting autophagy level may help keep balance of the speed of OTM and periodontal health. Some researchers have reported that autophagy proteins play essential roles in generating the osteoclast ruffled border and bone resorption. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> This discrepancy could be attributable to the fact that autophagy plays different roles in cells. The role of autophagy in osteoclasts cannot be ignored during tooth movement, and we have demonstrated that autophagy affects PDL cells induced by orthodontic force during tooth movement. Autophagy mainly occurred in PDL cells during tooth movement, which caused PDL cells to secrete RANKL/OPG to inhibit osteoclastogenesis. Whether autophagy occurred in other cells, such as osteoclasts involved in OTM, and the specific mechanisms involved in these changes need to be further clarified.</p><p>Studies have shown that PDL cells can select and attract osteoclast precursors through the RANKL-RANK-OPG axis, causing them to migrate to the bone surface to form osteoclasts under compressive force. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> PDL stem cells also can regulate osteoclastic activities through RANKL/OPG system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> In this study, we found that the RANKL/OPG ratio first increased before decreasing over time. The decreases in this ratio are most likely due to autophagy in PDL cells. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the expression of autophagy markers and found that the RANKL/OPG ratio was lower when autophagy was promoted and higher when autophagy was inhibited.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Autophagy in PDL cells was activated under compressive force and regulated osteoclast activity by inhibiting the RANKL/OPG system. This study provides the first scientific evidence showing that autophagy plays a role during tooth movement. These findings increase our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the changes in dynamics that occur during tooth movement. In addition, the knowledge gained from the study might be useful for designing novel treatments in the future.</p></div>
