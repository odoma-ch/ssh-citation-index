<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This article examines the consequences of co-workers' voice climate, defined as a shared perception regarding how individuals who work together within the same unit and who do not have formal authority over each other judge the ability to participate in decision making inside teams. We argue that co-workers' voice climate may influence individuals' perception of quality of social exchange with the team, operationalised through team-member exchange. These high-quality exchanges with the team should, in turn, promote higher individual affective commitment towards the team. Furthermore, we hypothesised that the social exchange with the supervisor, operationalised through leader-member exchange, buffers the effect of co-workers' voice climate on team-member exchange.</p><p>These hypotheses were tested using a sample of 183 employees belonging to 31 teams. Our findings supported the theoretical model that was proposed, attesting to the importance of considering co-workers' justice climate in the prediction of individual work attitudes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>Prior research on workplace justice mainly focused on justice stemming from the supervisor or the organisation, that is, on sources having power over the justice recipient <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Masterson, Lewis, Goldman, &amp; Taylor, 2000)</ref>. However, recent research has suggested that employees are receptive to other sources of justice and, in particular, to their co‐workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Li &amp; Cropanzano, 2009)</ref>. Making the distinction among the sources of justice is of primary importance for both theoretical and practical reasons. Theoretically, the concept of justice is rooted in the notion of accountability, so that the social entity responsible for the (un)just treatment received is fundamental to justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Folger &amp; Cropanzano, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rupp, Shao, Jones, &amp; Liao, 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, because co‐workers' have no formal power over the justice recipient, the mechanism responsible for the effects of co‐workers' justice may well be different than those found for justice coming from the supervisor or the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Li, Cropanzano, &amp; Bagger, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ohana, 2016)</ref>. Practically, given the increased use of workgroups in organisations and the meaningfulness of the workgroup as a proximal entity for employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lyubovnikova, West, Dawson, &amp; Carter, 2014)</ref>, studying co‐workers' justice is worth studying in many work environments.</p><p>The goal of this article is precisely to study the effect of co‐workers' justice climate. To operationalise co‐workers' justice, we focus on co‐workers' voice—that is, the opportunity to express one's opinion with respect to team decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ohana, 2016)</ref>. Voice is one of the most widely documented criteria of justice in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Shapiro &amp; Brett, 2005)</ref>. Accordingly, the results of the present study on the effects of co‐workers' voice will be more directly comparable with the myriad of studies dealing with organisation or supervisor voice. Moreover, teams of co‐workers are increasingly inclined to make their own decisions in the modern workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2016)</ref>. Contrarily to other procedural justice criteria that are more likely to emanate from an authority figure, voice fits thus particularly well with the topic addressed in the present research, that is, justice inside teams. In this paper, we thus use the concept of voice derived from the procedural justice literature and not the voice concept coming from the literature on proactive behaviours (where it refers to a prosocial behaviour, defined as a promotive behaviour that emphasises constructive challenge intended to improve a situation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Building on this operationalisation, our study aims at examining the multilevel relationship between co‐workers' voice climate and individual affective commitment towards the team. Affective commitment towards the team is defined as employees' emotional connection with their team. It represents a crucial variable in organisational
behaviour as it explains key attitudes and behaviours such as turnover intention, performance, and citizenship behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Meyer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Riketta &amp;amp; van Dick, 2005)</ref>. Above and beyond this direct effect, we further explore this relationship by examining a mediating mechanism in terms of social exchange, that is, team–member exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Seers, Petty, &amp; Cashman, 1995)</ref>. Finally, we identify a boundary condition of the co‐workers' justice climate–team–member exchange relationship by testing the moderating role of leader–member exchange (LMX). We argue that the effect of the quality of the exchange relationship with the supervisor is worth studying given the central role supervisors play in the team dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boies &amp; Howell, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>By doing so, the contribution of our research is threefold. First, we contribute to the justice literature by studying
justice emanating from co‐workers'. In this way, we respond to the call of <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rupp et al. (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Li et al. (2013)</ref> for conducting more research on justice emanating from other sources than the organisation or the supervisors. By focusing on the co‐workers' justice source, we also shed new light on the relationship between justice climate and commitment that does not provide so far a consistent pattern of results across studies whatever the source of justice. Another major contribution of our research is to explore the black box of justice climate <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mayer &amp; Kuenzi, 2010)</ref>. Relying on a unique theoretical framework, that is, the social exchange theory, we indeed propose to examine why and when co‐workers' voice climate is related to a valuable outcome such as affective commitment towards the team. If justice climate has been shown to impact individual attitudes and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Whitman, Caleo, Carpenter, Horner, &amp; Bernerth, 2012)</ref>, little is indeed known about why these relationships exist. Whereas the effect of justice on social exchange is well known at the individual level of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Colquitt et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rupp et al., 2014)</ref>, evidence is lacking when justice is considered as a group variable. Studying the mediating effect of individual social exchange between justice climate and individual outcomes is thus of crucial importance. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mayer and Kuenzi (2010)</ref> stated, "to date little research on justice climate has examined mediators of justice climate effects-an important issue given that the link between justice climate and the outcomes is not as intuitive as for other types of climate. Given the lack of obvious conceptual symmetry between justice climate and the diversity of outcomes examined, we think it is especially important to highlight the theoretical mechanisms that may help explain justice climate effects" (p. 334).</p><p>Finally, we contribute to the extant literature by studying when justice climate has stronger or weaker effects, as suggested by several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Lin &amp; Leung, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rupp, Bashshur, &amp; Liao, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Whitman et al., 2012)</ref>. In particular, building on the social exchange theory, this research examines whether exchange relationships that employees develop with their supervisor reinforce or attenuate the effects of voice climate on the quality of the exchanges experienced with the other team members. The use of an individual variable pertaining to the most proximal environment of the employee may help to explain why people react differently to the same justice event. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> provides with an overview of our conceptual model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Co-workers' voice climate, TMX, and individual affective commitment towards the team</head><p>Procedural justice refers to justice perceptions with regard to the procedures used to make decisions. The outcomes of these decisions are not the purpose of concern: It is the way these outcomes are achieved that matters. For example, if people can voice their opinions regarding the execution of a procedure, they perceive it to be fair <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Folger &amp; Cropanzano, 1998)</ref>. Participation in decision making (or "voice") represents thus an operationalisation of procedural justice. It is derived from both the "process control effect" <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Thibaut &amp; Walker, 1975)</ref>, which consists in having control over the presentation of arguments, and the "representativeness" criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Leventhal, 1980)</ref>, which is completed if the opinions of the various groups affected by the decision have been considered. In reactive research where justice is considered as an independent variable, it is recommended to measure procedural justice through only one criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Colquitt &amp; Shaw, 2005)</ref>. Voice is the most relevant criterion as, alone, it explains roughly the same proportion of variance in key constructs than the Leventhal's six criteria altogether <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, &amp; Ng, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, voice has been found to have an impact on a myriad of outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Wood &amp; Wall, 2007)</ref>, including job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Farndale, Van Ruiten, Kelliher, &amp; Hope-Hailey, 2011)</ref> and organisational commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Holland, Pyman, Cooper, &amp; Teicher, 2011)</ref>. The conceptualisation of voice that we refer to in the present paper differs from that which can be found in the literature on proactive behaviours. In the latter case, voice is indeed defined as a promotive behaviour that emphasises expression of constructive challenge intended to improve a situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Van Dyne &amp; LePine, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Contrarily to procedural voice, proactive voice entails an element of risk for the voicer because it challenges the status quo <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Detert &amp; Burris, 2007)</ref>. The two voice conceptions are not of the same nature because procedural voice represents the opportunity to express his/her opinion (whatever the use of this opportunity) whereas proactive voice is the actual expression of opinion. This distinction may lead to different conclusions: "Despite the conventional wisdom that voice is healthy for organizations, when teased apart by level (e.g., individual vs. organization) or literature (e.g., justice vs. proactive behavior), the effects of voice are rather mixed" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bashshur &amp; Oc, 2015, pp. 1-2)</ref>.</p><p>Most research on justice in general and voice in particular have mainly been conducted focusing on the organisation or the supervisor as the source of justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Masterson et al., 2000)</ref>. Far from emanating solely from the organisation or the supervisor, justice may, however, stem from other sources pertaining to the workplace. Further, identifying the entity accountable for their feeling of fairness is part of the development of employees' justice judgements <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel, &amp; Rupp, 2001)</ref>. In this perspective, one possible source of justice may well be co-workers. In the modern workplace, employees increasingly work in teams inside organisations in which hierarchies are more flat than ever before <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2016)</ref>. In such a work context, co-workers have now the possibility to deliver processes and can thus be considered as a source of justice on their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Li, Cropanzano, &amp; Molina, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Molina, Jakopec, Cropanzano, &amp; Moliner, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rupp et al., 2014)</ref>. Several empirical studies have already supported the view that co-workers can be considered as a source of justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cropanzano, Li, &amp; Benson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lavelle, McMahan, &amp; Harris, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Li et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Li &amp; Cropanzano, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ohana, 2016)</ref>. Nevertheless, research studying procedural justice emanating from co-workers in general and voice in particular remains scarce. One exception is <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ohana (2016)</ref> who studied the impact of co-workers' voice (i.e., individual's perception of how voice is displayed towards him/her by the group) on team citizenship behaviour. He found that this relationship was mediated by team commitment and moderated by neuroticism. His study focused on the link between individuallevel voice perceptions and the team consequences of these perceptions.</p><p>However, co-workers' justice also makes sense when it is considered at a higher level, such as the team level.</p><p>Indeed, when confronted to any situation, employees' reactions are contingent on both their own and others' justice perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Colquitt, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dietz, Robinson, Folger, Baron, &amp; Schulz, 2003)</ref>. Only a few studies have addressed this form of co-workers' justice at the group level of analysis, called the "Intraunit Procedural Justice Climate" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Li &amp; Cropanzano, 2009)</ref> or "Peer Procedural Justice" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cropanzano et al., 2011)</ref>. It is defined as "shared perceptions of the extent to which unit members treat each other fairly" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Li &amp; Cropanzano, 2009, p. 585)</ref>. Concretely, it represents a justice climate so that individual perceptions need to be aggregated at the group level in order to capture it. Again, this procedural voice climate needs to be distinguished from the voice climate that can be found in the proactive voice literature. Proactive voice climate is defined as shared employee perceptions of the extent to which they are encouraged to speak up and make suggestions in the workplace <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Frazier &amp; Fainshmidt, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">, Morrison, Wheeler-Smith, &amp; Kamdar, 2011)</ref>. It captures the contextual influences that encourage employee voice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Morrison et al. (2011)</ref> conceptualise proactive group voice climate as having two dimensions. The first is a shared belief about whether speaking up is safe versus dangerous (i.e., group voice safety beliefs). The second dimension of group voice climate is a shared belief about whether group members are able to voice effectively (i.e., group voice efficacy). These two dimensions that define proactive group voice climate are not found in the justice climate literature because in the latter case, procedural voice, as an opportunity, has no element of risk and does not directly deal with the effectiveness of speaking up.</p><p>The scant stream of research on the topic has shown that co-workers' justice climate has an explanatory power on individual outcomes above and beyond individual-level justice perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Li et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Molina et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Indubitably, the effect of (in)justice is more salient when most of the group members have been treated (un)fairly as compared with when only one member has been treated (un)fairly <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liao &amp; Rupp, 2005)</ref>. In line with this view, some studies indicate that justice climate predicts several individual-level attitudes and behaviours such as job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mossholder, &amp; Bennett, Martin, 1998)</ref>, team citizenship behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cropanzano et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ehrhart, 2004)</ref> and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cropanzano et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Naumann &amp; Bennett, 2002)</ref>. Comparatively, the relationship between justice climate and commitment is less clear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Naumann and Bennett (2000)</ref> did not find any significant link between organisational procedural justice climate and organisational commitment. In their paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Liao and Rupp (2005)</ref> found that organisational procedural justice only (and not interactional and informational justice) is linked to organisational commitment. However, the significance of the effect (p &lt; 0.05, one tailed) suggests a very weak relationship. Contrarily to the previous studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Simons and Roberson (2003)</ref> showed a significant relationship between justice climate and the aggregation of individual affective commitment at the department level. Quite similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ohana (2014)</ref> tested the impact of justice climate on individual affective commitment. All forms of justice examined (interpersonal, procedural, and informational) in the study significantly predicted the individual feelings of affective commitment. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Simons and Roberson (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ohana (2014)</ref>, one may reasonably assume that co-workers' voice climate affects individual affective commitment towards the team.</p><p>An explanatory mechanism of the effect of co-workers' voice climate on individual affective commitment towards the team is grounded in the social exchange theory and the norm of reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blau, 1964;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2016)</ref>. Following this theoretical framework, an exchange relationship occurs between two parties when one party provides a benefit to the other thereby initiating an obligation to reciprocate by delivering something beneficial in return. The quality of social exchange among a person and other workgroup members can be captured through the "team-member exchange" construct. Team-member exchange refers to the quality of "the reciprocity between a member and his or her team with respect to the member's contribution of ideas, feedback, and assistance to other members and, in turn, the member's receipt of information, help, and recognition from other team members" <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Seers et al., 1995, p. 21)</ref>.</p><p>In the present research, we propose that team-member exchange mediates the relationship between co-workers' voice climate and individual affective commitment towards the team. This assumption relies on the target similarity model <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2016)</ref> that conceptualises the development of social exchange relationships as a two-stage process. It advocates that fairness perceptions from workgroup members primarily predict a high level of social exchange with that specific entity (Phase 1) and, finally, positive attitudes towards this entity (Phase 2). Applied to the justice climate perspective, that means that an employee who belongs to a team where members can voice their opinions will interpret positively the exchanges that occur with that team and perceive that this team takes care of him/her <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Wayne, Shore, &amp; Bommer, 2002)</ref>. When voice is available in the team, it increases the team members' felt control over the decision-making process within the team (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Folger, 1977)</ref>. Beyond its ability to influence the outcomes and decisions of the team, voice also conveys a message of interpersonal respect and valorisation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Tyler and Blader, 2003)</ref>. Belonging to a team where all agree on the fact that opinions and feelings regarding the group can be voiced is thus a valuable input into employees' judgements of the quality of the exchange relationships. An employee experiencing such a team climate is more likely to feel that the team members recognise his/her potential, understand his/her problems and needs, and that help is available when needed. This first phase puts the social exchange in motion. Once he/she receives goodwill gestures, he/she may then reciprocate with positive attitudes towards the team during a second phase. Indeed, social exchange evolve into commitment over time because it motivates him/her to create and maintain a social bond with his/her workgroup <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cropanzano et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cropanzano &amp; Mitchell, 2016)</ref>. The employee will embody group membership into his/her self-definition and thus develop an individual affective commitment towards the team <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lavelle et al., 2009)</ref>. We thus argue that how others are treated in the team influences the individual's TMX and his/her subsequent commitment towards the team. In line with this proposition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cropanzano et al. (2011)</ref> found that procedural and interactional justice climate are related to teamwork process (i.e., a concept that integrates some notions of social exchange) which, in turn, influences employees' citizenship behaviours towards the team. On the basis of the above, we thus hypothesise that H1. TMX mediates the relationship between co-workers' voice climate and individual affective commitment towards the team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| LMX as moderator</head><p>As noted above, the next step in advancing the research stream on justice climate is to identify potential moderators of its effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Karriker &amp; Williams, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Li et al., 2013)</ref>. In agreement with this proposition, our study further examines conditions under which co-workers' voice climate has either a greater or a lesser impact on TMX. The context in which the group operates may certainly affect this relationship. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Greenberg and Edwards (2009)</ref> argued that voice is indeed "influenced by factors inherent in the social dynamics of the workplace" (p. 282). In the same vein, social information processing theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978)</ref> suggests that supervisor's actions and statements are a primary source of influence in the workplace. Accordingly, we propose that the influence of supervisors is essential in determining employees' perceptions and their consequences in terms of attitudes and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boon &amp; Biron, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, the supervisor is the most proximal target to workgroup members (he/she is the face of the organisation).</p><p>Research have shown the very great importance of the supervisor in the workgroup justice context in general (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Skarlicki, van Jaarsveld, Shao, Song, &amp; Wang, 2016)</ref> and, more particularly, when voice inside team is at stake <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Frazier &amp; Bowler, 2015)</ref>. Among variables referring to the relationship with the supervisor, we decided to focus on LMX for three reasons. First, extensive empirical evidence on the quality of the supervisor-subordinate relationship show that this relationship is one of the most important an employee has and potentially one of the most important predictors of workplace outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Harris, Wheeler, &amp; Kacmar, 2009)</ref>. Second, it perfectly fits with our theoretical background based on social exchange because it mirrors TMX for the supervisor target. Using LMX thus permits to better analyse the interplay of the social exchange that an individual can have with two different work entities. Third, LMX is by nature an individual-level variable. Indeed, LMX theory suggests that a leader develops a unique exchange relationship with each follower <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997)</ref>. It thus fits particularly well our multilevel story that tries to understand individual factors that affect the effect of a climate variable.</p><p>LMX refers to the quality of exchanges between employees and their supervisors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dansereau, Graen, &amp; Haga, 1975)</ref>. LMX theory describes how leaders develop reciprocal relationships with their followers and posits that both parties exchange tangible and intangible resources. The more exchanges there are, the better the employees' perception of the quality of LMX. Employees with high LMX receive preferential treatment with more trust, respect, and obligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Schriesheim, Castro, &amp; Cogliser, 1999)</ref>. The extant literature has recognised that LMX <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997)</ref> and justice climate (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cropanzano et al., 2011)</ref> are both positively related with desired outcomes. Nevertheless, little is known about how these variables interact. In particular, does the absence or presence of a high LMX makes the relationships between co-workers' voice climate and job outcomes stronger or weaker? We expect that co-workers' voice climate will be differentially important depending on the quality of the relationship with the supervisor. More precisely, we suggest that the relationship between justice climate and TMX is strongest when LMX is lowest because employees are more likely to be influenced by their colleagues in time of uncertainty.</p><p>Indeed, affiliation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Schachter, 1959)</ref> suggests that the opinion of others should be most important for those employees who experience uncertainty and stressful events. According to this model, people search for social information in order to learn from the reactions of others and to help them to understand the significance of what happens. Situations of uncertainty are thus particularly favourable to social influence.</p><p>Precisely, we argue that employees experiencing poor LMX are more likely to undergo uncertainty about their standing inside the workgroup. Indeed, among others, when they have poor relationships with their supervisor, they may have difficulties to enjoy the benefits of any favourable act or gesture from their supervisor towards them, they may be less likely to engage in resource sharing, and more likely to perceive themselves as having less control over their actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boon &amp; Biron, 2016)</ref>. Because of these implications, employees experiencing low LMX are likely to feel higher uncertainty and higher stress from the situation. As a consequence, they will be more prone to search for social information in their proximal environment such as among their peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978)</ref>. The way other workgroup members allow each other to take a voice inside the group may thus be of a higher importance in determining their level of TMX. Particularly, because they tend to search for more social information in case of low LMX, employees will be the witness of more reciprocal exchanges taking part within the team that they may wish to reciprocate by participating to these high-quality social exchanges within the team and perceiving higher levels of TMX. As a whole, the above rationale suggests that, among employees experiencing low LMX, the relationship between co-workers' voice climate and TMX is likely to be amplified.</p><p>We thus hypothesise that H2. The effect of co-workers' voice climate on TMX will be moderated by LMX so that a low level of LMX will lead to a stronger co-workers' voice climate-TMX relationship compared with higher values of LMX.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Sample and procedure</head><p>The sample consisted of employees working in French health and social services, which include child protection centres, retirement homes, and homecare services. Most of these enterprises are members of a French network of social enterprises called UNIOPSS and founded in 1947. Within this network, we identified hybrid organisations, that is, organisations that combine properties associated with for-profit, public, and non-profit organisations. Among these identified organisations, we selected the participating organisations either on a random basis or through personal contacts. Apart from this network, we also contacted several enterprises that belonged to two other networks of health and social services organisations from the north and west of France and that can be characterised as hybrid organisations too. All the respondents from both networks were permanent staff members with administrative, medical, or social responsibilities. Paper-and-pencil questionnaires and prestamped return envelopes were distributed to employees. The latter were invited to provide in this questionnaire the name of their supervisor. This information was matched with the supervisors' names directly provided by each organisation in order to recompose the working groups. Questionnaires were distributed to 598 employees between the end of 2011 and 2015. This data collection length is due to the fact that we contacted the selected enterprises sequentially, that is, one by one, which makes the study a cross-sectional one. Importantly, during this time period, there was no political, legal, or institutional change that may have influenced our findings by creating a time effect.</p><p>We received in total 258 responses. We excluded one questionnaire with no responses on several variables of interest, 57 questionnaires with incorrect or no matching information, and 17 questionnaires from groups with less than three respondents, resulting in a final sample of 183 employees belonging to 31 workgroups (final response rate of 31%). Among these participants, 77% were females, 21% males, and 2% omitted to indicate their gender. In the final sample, most employees (32%) are between 36 and 45 years old. In addition, 18% worked with their workgroup since less than 1 year, 38% between 1 and 3 years, 32% between 3 and 10 years, and 10% for more than 10 years (2% omitted to indicate their tenure with their group).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Measures</head><p>For all measures, participants were invited to respond to each item using a 7-point Likert-type scale where 1 means strongly disagree and 7 equates strongly agree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">| Co-workers' voice</head><p>Perceptions of co-workers' voice were measured using <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ohana's (2016)</ref> 3-item scale inspired from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Colquitt et al. (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Jones, Scarpello, and Bergmann (1999)</ref>. A sample item was "I am able to express my views and feelings before decisions are made by other members of my work group." The Cronbach's α for this measure was 0.83, and its composite reliability was 0.85. Co-workers' voice climate was calculated by aggregating co-workers' voice at the group level, that is, by the mean of individual co-workers' voice among employees pertaining to the same working group. Specifically, we thus used a direct-consensus composition model for aggregating our co-workers' voice variable. It was then mandatory to verify both within-group agreement and between-group variability in order to justify the aggregation to the group level. The median rwg(j) was 0.70. Moreover, intraclass correlation (1) was 0.21, whereas intraclass correlation (2) was 0.77. The pattern from the above results justified the aggregation of our measure of co-workers' voice to the group level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">| Team-member exchange</head><p>To assess team-member exchange, we relied on the 10-item scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Seers et al. (1995)</ref>. A sample item is "Other members of my work group understand my problems and needs." The Cronbach's α is 0.87 whereas the composite reliability is 0.88.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">| Individual affective commitment towards the team</head><p>Individual affective commitment towards the team were measured with the 3-item scale from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bentein, Stinglhamber, and Vandenberghe (2002)</ref>. A sample item was "My work group has a great deal of personal meaning for me." The Cronbach's α is 0.92 and the composite reliability is 0.86.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">| Leader-member exchange</head><p>LMX was measured with the 7-item scale from <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Scandura and Graen (1984)</ref>. A sample item was "My manager understands my problems and needs." The Cronbach's α is 0.91 and the composite reliability is 0.93.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">| Control variables</head><p>As recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Becker (2005)</ref>, we examined the empirical relationships between three sociodemographic variables (age, tenure with group, and gender) and the dependent variables of our model (i.e., team-member exchange and individual affective commitment towards the team). Gender did not display significant correlations with the dependent variables of our model and was thus removed from subsequent analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| RESULTS</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations among variables.</p><p>The results of confirmatory factor analyses (using Lisrel 8.8) indicated that the hypothesised four-factor model provides a good fit to the data, χ 2 (224) = 502, root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) = 0.08, comparative fit index = 0.95. All factor loadings were significant at p &lt; 0.001. They range from 0.51 to 0.94, which is above the recommended cut-off value of 0.50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hair, Black, Babin, &amp; Anderson, 2010, p. 708)</ref> and confirms convergent validity. We also tested for alternative measurement models in order to explore the discriminant validity of the constructs.</p><p>All the alternative models that were tested provided a worse fit to the data. All Δχ2 are significant at p &lt; 0.001; three factors (TMX and team commitment together), χ2(227) = 910.95, RMSEA = 0.13; three factors (LMX and TMX together), χ2(227) = 2,000.76, RMSEA = 0.21; two factors (co‐workers' voice, TMX and team commitment together), χ2(229) = 1,030.77, RMSEA = 0.14; one factor: χ2(230) = 2,587, RMSEA = 0.24. We can thus be confident that the scales capture distinct constructs.</p><p>We used standard multilevel modelling with the software HLM7 to test our hypotheses, given the nested structure of our data and the multilevel nature of our hypotheses. Employees constituted the Level 1 cases nested within Level 2 workgroups. All Level 1 predictors were group‐mean centred, and co‐worker justice climate was grand‐mean centred at Level 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002)</ref>. The results of these multilevel analyses first showed no significant improvement of Model 1 over the null model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; Δdeviance = 1.16, Δdf = 7, p &gt; 0.05).</p><p>Co-workers' voice climate is positively associated with individual affective commitment towards the team beyond the effect of individual-level co-workers' voice perceptions (Model 2, γ = 0.50, standard error [SE] = 0.10, p &lt; 0.01).</p><p>To test for the mediating effect of TMX proposed in Hypothesis 1, we first analysed the relationship between co-workers' voice climate and TMX. As Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows, co-workers' voice climate positively predicted TMX (Model 4; γ = 0.50, SE = 0.09, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Second, we entered the mediator (i.e., TMX) in Model 3. Following the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Zhang, Zyphur, and Preacher (2009)</ref> to avoid potential confounding of the estimates of the mediator's effect, we group-mean centred TMX and added its subtracted mean back to the Level 2 as covariates. The estimate of co-workers' voice climate lost predictive validity over affective commitment towards the team (γ = 0.23, SE = 0.13, ns), whereas TMX predicted affective commitment towards the team (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Model 3; γ = 0.57, SE = 0.11, p &lt; 0.001). As a whole, TMX mediated the relationship between co-workers' voice climate and affective commitment towards the team (Sobel test z = 3.79, p &lt; 0.001). In order to assess the significance of the indirect effect, we then used the Monte Carlo estimation approach to construct 95% confidence intervals for our hypothesised indirect effect. The results showed that the indirect effect of co-workers' voice climate on individual affective commitment towards the team via TMX (p = 0.28) was significant with 95% confidence interval [0.15, 0.45], which excludes zero. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is confirmed.</p><p>We finally tested the moderating effect of LMX on the relationship between co-workers' voice climate and TMX (Hypothesis 2). The results shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> (Model 5) indicated that the interaction term between co-workers' voice climate and LMX is significant (γ = -0.17, SE = 0.07, p &lt; 0.05). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> summarises the results obtained through Models 3 and 5.</p><p>To determine whether this significant interaction provided support for Hypothesis 2, we plotted the interaction at one standard deviation below and above the mean following the procedure described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Preacher, Curran, and Bauer (2006;</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Consistent with Hypothesis 2, the positive relationship between co-workers' voice climate and TMX was significantly stronger among employees reporting low levels of LMX (z = 6.01) than for those employees reporting high levels of LMX (z = 1.99). Thus, the pattern of the interaction confirms the relationships posited in Hypothesis 2. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">| DISCUSSION</head><p>This study has shed new light on the effects of justice perceptions emanating from co-workers. More precisely, our findings show that co-workers' voice climate lead to individual affective commitment towards the team through TMX.</p><p>Results also suggest that for employees with poor LMX, co-workers' voice climate is more important in the formation of high-quality TMX relationships. A contrario, high LMX inhibits co-workers' voice climate role in determining TMX and then individual affective commitment towards the team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">| Theoretical implications</head><p>These results highlight three theoretical contributions. First, our results confirm knowledge on the role of co‐workers in determining perceptions of justice. Although several meta‐analyses have examined the outcomes of justice emanating from different sources, their focus has exclusively been on the supervisor and organisation sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Colquitt et al., 2013;</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Rupp et al., 2014)</ref>. The primary reason of the absence of other sources like co‐workers in these meta‐analyses is that studies exploring this justice source are much scarcer. However, conducting research on this source is of primary importance as results obtained from sources such as the organisation or the supervisor can differ for co‐workers who have, contrarily to the two former sources, no formal power over the recipients of justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Li et al., 2013;</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ohana, 2016)</ref>. Consistent with an emerging and scarce literature conducted at the individual level of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ohana, 2016)</ref> and group level of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Li et al., 2013)</ref>, we show that workgroup members can also be responsible of fairness perceptions despite the fact that workgroup members have no formal authority upon each other. Taking into consideration accountability in justice research releases a promising area for linking justice research with behavioural ethics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cropanzano &amp; Stein, 2009;</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Treviño, Weaver, &amp; Reynolds, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Second, our results contribute to the literature on justice by both showing a link between co‐workers' voice climate and individual affective commitment towards the team and explaining this relationship through social exchange. Our study is the first one to show a relationship between a kind of co‐workers' justice climate and commitment towards the team. Indeed, the link between co‐workers' voice and commitment towards the team has been only explored at the individual level of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ohana, 2016)</ref>. Our research goes further by shedding new light on the existence of that relationship at a higher level of analysis. Furthermore, this positive effect of co‐workers' voice climate on the group is also important for the organisation as a whole. Indeed, commitment towards the team might have some positive impact on employees' attitudes towards the organisation. Because workgroup are nested in organisations, when workers feel committed to their workgroup, they tend to feel also attached to their organisation and display less turnover than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Vandenberghe, Bentein, &amp; Stinglhamber, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Our study thus contributes to the literature on justice by providing an explanation of its effects through social exchange. Indeed, whereas effects of justice climate begin to be largely studied, little is known about the mechanisms underlying those relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mayer &amp; Kuenzi, 2010)</ref>. At the individual level of analysis, a myriad of studies use social exchange as a mediator between justice and commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2016)</ref>. But nothing guaranteed that the same mechanism explains justice climate effects as the logic may well be different among distinct levels of analysis. Our study goes one step further by showing that individual social exchange mediates the effect of justice climate on commitment when the focus at stake is the workgroup.</p><p>Third, our study contributes to the knowledge on justice climate by studying an individual boundary condition of its effects. Another gap in justice climate research is the lack of knowledge of the conditions under which justice climate has stronger or weaker effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rupp et al., 2007;</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Whitman et al., 2012)</ref>. In our study, we showed that LMX moderates the co‐workers' voice climate—TMX relationship. Indeed, an unfavourable relationship with one's supervisor strengthens the positive effect of co‐workers' voice climate on exchange quality with the team members. Or, in other words, experiencing good social exchanges with one's supervisor weakens the effect of co‐workers' voice climate on TMX. LMX thus plays the role of a “substitute for co‐workers' justice” <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kerr &amp; Jermier, 1978)</ref>. As a whole, these findings point out the compensatory effects of variables emanating from different sources (i.e., the co‐workers versus the supervisor), that is, the fact than one source may compensate for the effect of another. More generally, our results showed that a variable capturing an individual's relationship with his/her supervisor strongly impacts the relationship between variables targeting team members. Exchange relationships that employees develop with their supervisor indirectly reinforce or attenuate the development of exchange relationships they have in their co‐workers. Our results are in line with studies showing the role that supervisors play regarding relationships involving the customers <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Skarlicki et al., 2016)</ref> or the organisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Farndale et al., 2011)</ref>. Further, this kind of cross‐foci effects can explain the mixed empirical support found for target‐specific reactions at the individual level of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Colquitt et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, even if our paper refers to voice as conceptualised in the organisational justice literature, it also indirectly provides new insights and a better understanding of the general context of speaking up in groups. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mowbray et al. (2015, p. 383)</ref> stated, “the differences in the conceptualization and definition of employee voice across the disciplines does not provide just reason to exclude and ignore the findings from another discipline, but rather it provides the opportunity to look at employee voice from a different perspective and to incorporate some of the key findings and research from each discipline” (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bashshur &amp; Oc, 2015)</ref>. In line with this statement, our research stresses out the importance of the accountability of the voice climate as the effect may differ depending on the source <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Molina, Moliner, Martínez‐Tur, Cropanzano, &amp; Peiró, 2015)</ref>. Indeed, the proactive voice literature considers several sources as responsible of the risk and efficacy of speaking up. For example, this source is the supervisor for <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Frazier and Bowler (2015)</ref>, the group for <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Walumbwa, Morrison, and Christensen (2012)</ref>, or unspecified for <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Morrison et al. (2011)</ref>. Our research urges researchers to take into consideration the potential different effects of speaking up depending on the entity considered as responsible of the positive or negative voice climate. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b">Detert and Treviño (2010)</ref> who analysed in a qualitative study the different entities responsible of voice such as the direct supervisor or senior managers, future research should thus also consider co‐workers as a potential source of voice climate. Finally, the present research helps to contribute to our understanding of speaking up in groups by highlighting the context in which voice is perceived positively. Indeed, our study is in line with research suggesting that the context influences speaking up <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Frazier &amp; Bowler, 2015)</ref>. It highlights the central role that exchange with the supervisor can have, even if voice only happens among workgroup members. Conversely, future research on procedural voice could benefit from the literature on proactive voice. Indeed, our research may benefit from taking into account in future research the actual voice expression of group members in determining their level of TMX. In a more general manner, both streams of literature should be integrated in order to model a process of voice <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bashshur &amp; Oc, 2015)</ref>. For example, relative to our model, it would be worthwhile to consider sequentially voice opportunity for group members, voice expression by group members, and voice response by supervisor in order to better understand affective commitment towards the team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">| Managerial implications</head><p>As we demonstrated, co-workers' voice climate is an antecedent of TMX and individual affective commitment towards the team, which are both fundamental for the organisation's efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our study thus supports the idea that organisations should take care to create workgroup environments in which employees can participate in decision making. Several recommendations to both organisations and managers can be suggested to foster such a workgroup environment.</p><p>First of all, organisations should emphasise the necessity to voice opinions inside the workgroup. One way to implement this recommendation would be to integrate in performance evaluations or 360-degree performance feedback the extent to which employees encourage their colleagues in participating in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cropanzano et al., 2011)</ref>. Organisations may also use employee training to foster co-workers' voice climate. Indeed, training is an effective tool to spread justice in organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Skarlicki &amp; Latham, 1997)</ref>. For example, training programmes that develop employees' competences in decision making and the new techniques in participative decision making may improve co-workers' voice climate and thus benefit the workgroup and, finally, the organisation.</p><p>Managers may similarly benefit from our findings in order to nurture social exchange and commitment inside their teams. They may act as role-models as fair behaviours are spread from the top of the company to the employees <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Li et al., 2013)</ref>. In this vein, by themselves encouraging voice inside their team, they will promote participative decision making among workgroup members. They can also avoid the contamination of the group by individuals with low voice perceptions. On the one hand, managers have to prevent individuals from transmitting negative justice images within the group by instantly intervening and restoring a participative decision making among workgroup members. On the other hand, they can sustain a good co-workers' voice climate by controlling the stories and legends about how groups are functioning throughout the organisation. They may create favourable channels of contagion by spreading success stories of workgroups that had a high participation in the decision-making process. Lastly, because positive LMX buffers the negative effect of poor co-workers' voice climate, managers need to develop social exchange with their subordinates, particularly when the team does not share decision making. In that case, managers may give particular attention to establish social exchanges of quality with almost all employees. Indeed, any outgroup with whom they have poor relationships may spread negative attitudes emanating from a poor co-workers' voice climate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">| Limitations and perspectives for future research</head><p>This study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design rules out conclusions about the causal direction among the variables of our research model. We cannot exclude for instance a reverse causation between TMX and co-workers' voice climate. One can reasonably assume that, because employees pertaining to the same workgroup have high-quality exchange relationships among them, they then develop a workgroup climate where the opportunity to voice one's opinion is particularly present. Nevertheless, our model is in line with previous theoretical frameworks that propose social exchange variables as consequences of justice perceptions and as antecedents of commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2016)</ref>. We thus have some confidence in the hypothesised direction of the relationships.</p><p>However, future research may provide more evidence based on longitudinal designs with repeated measures in order to draw causal inferences. Furthermore, future studies with larger sample sizes could also replicate our results using multilevel structural equation modelling.</p><p>Second, data to measure the variables included in our model were collected from a unique source in this cross-sectional study. It may raise concerns about the possibility that the common method variance bias has impacted our results <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003)</ref>. At the statistical level, we demonstrated scales' validity using confirmatory factor analyses and provided evidence that our constructs should be considered as</p><p>distinct. We also conducted the Harman single-factor test <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>, which indicated that the fit of the one-factor model was very poor, χ 2 (230) = 2,587, RMSEA = 0.24, Δdf = 6, Δχ 2 = 2,085, p &lt; 0.01. As recommended by some scholars <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Conway &amp; Lance, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Podsakoff et al., 2003)</ref>, we also caught several precautions at the methodological level to limit this threat. We assured potential participants of the anonymity or confidentiality of their responses and stressed that there were no right or wrong answers to the questions. We also used validated scales to measure our study variables. More importantly, common source bias is likely to lead to an attenuation of any interaction effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Siemsen, Roth, &amp; Oliveira, 2010)</ref>. Therefore, finding a significant interaction in our study provides strong evidence that an interaction exists. It therefore reduced our concerns regarding this potential bias in our data. Nevertheless, future research may benefit from corroborating our results by means of alternative measures (e.g., peer-ratings of TMX or commitment towards the team).</p><p>Third, our reliance on a convenient sample of employees working in French health and social services made it hard to assess the extent to which our results would generalise to more general populations of workers. However, the results found so far on the effects of voice and social exchange in social enterprises totally replicate the findings of research conducted in other organisational contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ohana, Meyer, &amp; Swaton, 2013)</ref>. There is thus no reason to anticipate that our findings are context-specific, which should somehow alleviate this concern. Still, it remains important for future research to rely on more representative samples. In the same vein, despite a response rate that is within the norm for studies conducted at individual level, more responses per workgroup would be better to corroborate the satisfactory agreement we have in each group and ensure their representativeness.</p><p>Finally, we test the effect of only one mediator (i.e., TMX) and one moderator (i.e., LMX). First, the mediating mechanism explaining the effect of co-worker voice climate on team commitment is based on the social exchange framework. Future research may study this mediating effect of social exchange at another level of analysis by considering TMX as a group-level variable measuring average reciprocity inside the groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dierdorff, Bell, &amp; Belohlav, 2011)</ref>. It is also possible that other mechanisms might be at stake <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mayer &amp; Kuenzi, 2010)</ref>. For example, positive emotions can explain why justice climate engenders positive attitudinal and behavioural outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lin, 2015)</ref>. Future studies integrating several concomitant mediators are thus needed to understand how justice climate predicts individual attitudes and behaviours. Second, in order to fully understand the interplay between justice climate and social exchange, future research might study the potential role of other individual-level moderators such as the Big Five dimensions that prove to impact the effect of co-workers' justice <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ohana, 2016)</ref> or organisationallevel moderators such as human resources management practices. Finally, we chose individual affective commitment towards the team as an outcome because, among others, it represents the second phase of the social exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lavelle, Rupp, &amp; Brockner, 2016)</ref>, and it is a crucial variable that strongly explains a myriad of attitudes and behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Meyer, 2016)</ref>. However, future research may study the impact of co-workers' justice climate on other outcomes such as in-role performance and organisational citizenship behaviours.</p></div>
